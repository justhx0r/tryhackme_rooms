Emails are comprised of several components, including the header, body, and, if applicable, any attachments. The standard that emails generally follow is defined by the <i>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</i>, specifically in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322" target="_blank">RFC 5322</a>, which specifies the syntax and semantics of email messages, and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045" target="_blank">RFC 2045-2049</a> series, which defines the <i>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)</i> standard for email messages on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Email Headers</span></p>\n<p>The email headers are a great place to start when manually investigating a suspicious email. Email headers contain important metadata and information such as the sender and recipient\'s email addresses, the date and time the email was sent, and the path the message took to reach its intended destination. Investigating email headers can provide valuable insights into an email\'s origin and potential security concerns.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Viewing Email Headers</span></p>\n\n<p>The process for viewing an email\'s headers can vary depending on the email client or service you are using. Sometimes in the specific email\'s context or view menu, there will be an option to view the headers directly or to download the original message as a file. In our case, we already have a copy of the email Paul received in <code>.eml</code> format. The <code>.eml</code> file format is in plaintext, meaning it can be read and edited using a basic text editor like Notepad, TextEdit, or Sublime Text.</p>\n\n<p>To investigate this email further, open up <code>URGENTParrotPostAccountUpdateRequired.eml</code> in Sublime Text. You can optionally copy the file\'s contents and paste it into an email headers analyzer tool, such as <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx" target="_blank">MXToolbox</a><span style="font-size:1rem"> or </span><a href="https://mha.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Message Header Analyzer</a><span style="font-size:1rem">. These client-side web tools provide a more graphical view of the email headers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Common Email Headers</span></p>\n\n<p>You are probably used to seeing several standard email headers, as most email clients (like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and others) will display these headers by default:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><b>Subject</b> - This provides a topic or summary of the email\'s content</li>\n<li><b>From</b> - This identifies the sender of the email message (this can easily be spoofed!)</li>\n<li><b>To</b> - This identifies the primary recipient(s) of the email</li>\n<li><b>Date</b> - Indicates the date and time when the email message was sent</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Below, visually locate where these headers are mapped to in Paul\'s email client, as seen from the Outlook on the Web (OWA) app.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6490641ea027b100564fe00a/room-content/784ae7675403e49d2f41f67a27b551c5.png" alt="Labelled diagram mapping the components the email\'s screenshot to common headers found in the OWA email client." style="width:749.479px;height:192.094px" /><br /></p>\n\n<p>Most email headers will not be visible directly from an email client, so we need a text editor to view the complete email header information.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s also important to understand that any line in an email can be forged or spoofed. However, there are some headers that you can trust more than others when conducting analysis. For example, the "Received" headers are added by each email server that processes the email, and they can offer a record of the email\'s path from source to destination.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Identifying the Source<br /></span></p>\n<p>Because email headers are so easily spoofed, it can be challenging to determine the originating sender or source of an email. As mentioned earlier, the "Received" headers are added by email servers to show the path the email took. The sender\'s IP address is typically listed in the first "Received" header (look at the date/times!).</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6490641ea027b100564fe00a/room-content/2b448337d00799c72eceb541e8706218.png" alt="Received header information for Paul\'s email, indicating an IP address of 109.205.120.0" style="width:50%" /><br /></p>\n\n<p>Once you have identified the source IP address, you can use an IP lookup tool to find out more information about the sender, such as their ISP (Internet Service Provider) or the geographic location of their IP address. Several free tools are available online, such as <a href="https://iplocation.io/" target="_blank">iplocation.io</a> and <a href="https://www.iplocation.net/ip-lookup" target="_blank">iplocation.net</a>.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Custom Email Headers</span></p>\n<p>Email headers starting with "X-" are custom headers the sender can add. The "X-" prefix is typically used to denote that the header is not an official or standardized header defined by the IETF. These custom headers often provide additional information or metadata about the email, such as tagging the email for spam filtering or sorting purposes or adding information specific to a particular organization or system.</p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 3, 'taskCreated': '2023-05-01T16:33:40.500Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': '<p>According to the IP address, what country is the sending email server associated with?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>If Paul replies to this email, which email address will his reply be sent to?</p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': 'What is the value of the custom header in the email?', 'hint': ''}]}, {'taskTitle': 'Email Attachment Analysis', 'taskDesc': '<p>As we discovered by looking at the <code>.eml</code> file in a text editor, the email Paul received contains an embedded attachment named <i>"ParrotPostACTIONREQUIRED.htm."</i>\xa0Based on this file type and the listed <b>Content-Type</b>, this is an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) file used to create a web page or document that can be viewed in a web browser.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6490641ea027b100564fe00a/room-content/dfdd050be423941147bcc20e33f9c2c2.png" alt="Sublime Text output indicating that this attachment\'s filename is set to ParrotPostACTIONREQUIRED.html with a text/html Content-Type" style="width:735.979px;height:128.078px" /><span style="font-size:1rem"><br /></span></p>\n\n<p>Some email filters or security systems may be configured to block or quarantine certain file types, such as HTML files. By using alternatives like HTM or SHTM file extensions instead of HTML, attackers may be able to bypass these filters and increase the chances of their email reaching the intended recipient. A <code>.htm</code> file is the most common alternative to HTML and is similarly used to represent web pages written in HTML code.</p>\n\n<p>You may think receiving an HTML document attached to an email is inherently suspicious. While uncommon, there are valid reasons why a legitimate service may do so, such as including interactive forms or dynamic content. For example, secure mail platforms (like <i>Cisco Secure Email Encryption Service</i>) may also attach HTML documents to enhance the user experience with advanced features like encryption and authentication.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Content Transfer Encoding</span></p>\n\n<p>In the attachment metadata section of the .eml file, "Content-Transfer-Encoding" is a header that indicates how the attachment\'s content is encoded. Base64 encodes binary data (such as images, audio files, or other content) into ASCII characters that can be sent via email or other text-based channels.</p>\n\n<p>You will notice a large section of base64 encoded text at the end of the .eml file. This is the encoded contents of the embedded HTM file, which we can extract and manually decode, but typically attachments can be extracted through any modern email client.</p>\n\n<p>The attachment has been extracted and separated from the email to simplify this task. You can find this .htm file on the AttackBox under <code>/root/Rooms/ParrotPost</code> or download the <code>ParrotPostACTIONREQUIRED.htm</code> file by clicking on <b>Download Task Files</b> at the top of this task.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Analyzing the File</span></p>\n\n<p>Since <i>ParrotPostACTIONREQUIRED.htm</i> is a plaintext file, we can also open this up in Sublime Text.

Between this and the suspicious file extension, the original sender may have nefarious intentions and is actively trying to evade detection.</p>\n\n<p>This HTML document declares a variable called <code>b64</code> which is set to another long string of seemingly encoded data. Aside from the telling variable name, base64-encoded data typically includes the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, and padding characters (=). If you see these characters in a string of text, there is a good chance it may be base64-encoded.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">atob()</span></p>\n\n<p>After declaring the encoded string, the browser will execute the following line of JavaScript:</p>\n<p><code>document.write(unescape(atob(b64))); </code></p>\n\n<p>To break down this nested function:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>atob()</code> is a built-in JavaScript function to decode a base64-encoded string. This function passes in the <code>b64</code> variable that was previously declared as its input.</li>\n\n<li>The <code>unescape()</code>\xa0function converts any escaped characters in the decoded string into their original form. This is necessary because base64-encoded strings may contain special characters that must be appropriately formatted before being displayed on a webpage.</li>\n\n<li>The <code>document.write()</code> function displays the decoded and unescaped string on the webpage where the code is executed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The encoded variable likely contains the actual website content rendered at runtime. Because of this, we will need to go another layer deeper and decode the variable to find out what this webpage consists of.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Base64 Decoding</span></p>\n\n<p>There are many ways to decode base64 data, and a very common method is to use CyberChef, which is a powerful web-based application that provides tools for encoding, decoding, analyzing, and manipulating data in various formats. It can be found pre-installed on the AttackBox (navigate to <code>http://localhost:7777</code>), or it can be accessed on the Internet here:  <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" target="_blank">https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/</a></p>\n\n<p>To uncover the contents of the b64 variable, copy the entire base64 string (everything between the opening and closing quotation marks) and paste it into the <b>Input</b> field of CyberChef. From there, we can select the <b>From Base64</b> operation on the left-hand side of the page and drag it into the <b>Recipe</b> pane.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6490641ea027b100564fe00a/room-content/d14814855498e788a28dcdc7663bcc98.png" alt="CyberChef dashboard, base64 decoding the string from the HTM attachment file." style="width:901.88px;height:480.094px" /><br /></p>\n\n<p>If successful, you should see the decoded data under the <b>Output</b> pane.

This is because it\'s been compressed into a minified form, which means that all unnecessary characters, such as spaces, line breaks, and some comments, have been removed to reduce the file size. Minified code is often used in web development to reduce the loading time of web pages since smaller files can be loaded faster. However, it can make the code harder to read and understand for humans.</p>\n\n<p>We will work on making the code more human-readable shortly, but first, there appears to still be some encoding in the HTML. If you locate the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, you will notice a long string of seemingly random characters followed by semicolons. Ex: <code>&lt;h1&gt;&amp;#80;&amp;#97;&amp;#114;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;</code></p>\n\n<p>This is known as <b>HTML Entity Encoding</b>\xa0and is another trick that the author of this file is using to throw us off. HTML entities are special sequences of characters used to represent reserved characters and other special characters in HTML. Fortunately, CyberChef can handle the decoding process of HTML Entity characters.</p>\n\n<p>Copy everything from the opening <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag to the closing <code>&lt;/form&gt;</code> tag and paste it into the <b>Input</b> field of CyberChef. From there, search for "HTML Entity" in the <b>Operations</b> search bar and drag the <b>From HTML Entity</b> into the <b>Recipe</b> pane.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6490641ea027b100564fe00a/room-content/557e5fc2e65fcf541fd4854daa9e1a41.png" alt="CyberChef dashboard, HTML entity decoding the string from the HTM attachment file." style="width:918.575px;height:442px" /><br /></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style="color:rgb(99, 99, 99)"><i>Tip: Make sure you click <b>Clear Recipe </b>(trashcan icon) before this step so you do not attempt to base64 decode again as well!<br /></i></span></p>\n\n<p>Great!

The CSS has also gone through a <b>Minifier</b> to remove unnecessary whitespace, comments, and other characters that are not needed for the browser to interpret and display the styles correctly. If we wanted to understand the stylesheet more, we could copy and paste it into a <b>CSS Beautify</b> tool to make it more readable. <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" target="_blank">CyberChef</a> can perform CSS Beautify and CSS Minify operations.

However, that might not be the case; this may be a "fake" error message that attackers use to ease suspicion, whereas, in reality, our request containing credentials did go through in the background (through the beauty of asynchronous JavaScript).</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">Check the Network Requests</span></p>\n\n<p>By checking the <b>Network</b> tab in the browser\'s <b>Developer Tools</b>, we can quickly determine whether submitting the form sent a successful HTTP GET request.

We can navigate between different tabs to view information, such as the request and response headers. The <b>Response</b> tab will show any response content, such as the HTML, JSON, or XML response body. Sometimes this can give us more information about how the web server handles the request, depending on how verbose the server-side code is designed.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6490641ea027b100564fe00a/room-content/24ad269d388cb9f498b10586e2f33040.png" style="width:554.694px;height:259.594px" alt="The network request\'s details pane, indicating that the user credentials were sent to the webserver as URL parameters." /><br /></p>\n\n<p>Play around by testing a request and analyzing the response.
