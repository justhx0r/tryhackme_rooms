The scope of an engagement will vary by organization and what their infrastructure and posture look like. A client\'s scope will typically define what you\xa0<em>canno</em>t do or target; it can also include what you\xa0<em>can</em>\xa0do or target. While client objectives can be discussed and determined along with the providing team, a scope should only be set by the client. In some cases the red team may discuss a grievance of the scope if it affects an engagement. They should have a clear understanding of their network and the implications of an assessment. The specifics of the scope and the wording will always look different, below is an example of what verbiage may look like within a client\'s scope.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No exfiltration of data.</li>\n<li>Production servers are off-limits.</li>\n<li>10.0.3.8/18 is out of scope.</li>\n<li>10.0.0.8/20 is in scope.</li>\n<li>System downtime is not permitted under any circumstances.</li>\n<li>Exfiltration of PII is prohibited.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>When analyzing a client\'s objectives or scopes from a red team perspective, it is essential to understand the more profound meaning and implications.
