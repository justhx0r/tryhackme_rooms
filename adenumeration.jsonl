You can \nverify this by running the ping command against the IP of the \nTHMDC.za.tryhackme.com host. We do still need to configure DNS, however.\n Windows Networks use the Domain Name Service (DNS) to resolve hostnames\n to IPs. Throughout this network, DNS will be used for the \ntasks. You will have to configure DNS on the host on which you are \nrunning \nthe VPN connection. In order to configure our DNS, run the following \ncommand:</p><div class="terminal-container">\n  <div class="terminal-content">\n      <div class="terminal-top">Terminal</div>\n      <pre class="terminal-code">         <code class="language-shell-session">[thm@thm]$ systemd-resolve --interface enumad --set-dns $THMDCIP --set-domain za.tryhackme.com</code>\n      </pre>\n  </div>\n</div><p></p>Remember to replace $THMDCIP with the IP of THMDC in your network diagram. You can test that DNS is working by running:<p><code>nslookup thmdc.za.tryhackme.com</code></p><p>This should resolve to the IP of your DC. </p><p><b>Note:\n DNS may be reset on the AttackBox roughly every 3 hours. If this \noccurs, you will have to restart the systemd-resolved service.

Using <code>ifconfig</code> or <code>ip a</code>, make note of the IP of the <b>enumad</b> network adapter. This is your IP and the associated interface that you should use when performing the attacks in the tasks.<p></p><b><span style="font-size:18px">Other Hosts</span></b><br /><p>If\n you are going to use your own attack machine, an OpenVPN configuration \nfile will have been generated for you once you join the room.

Click the "Get Credentials" button to receive your credential pair that can be used for initial access.</p><p>This credential pair will provide you RDP and SSH access to THMJMP1.za.tryhackme.com. THMJMP1 can be seen as a jump host into this environment, simulating a foothold that you have achieved. Jump hosts are often targeted by the red team since they provide access to a new network segment. You can use Remmina or any other similar Remote Desktop client to connect to this host for RDP. Remember to specify the domain of za.tryhackme.com when connecting. Task 2 and 3 will require RDP access.</p><p>For SSH access, you can use the following SSH command:</p><p><code>ssh za.tryhackme.com\\\\&lt;AD Username&gt;@thmjmp1.za.tryhackme.com</code></p><p>When prompted, provide your account\'s associated password.

From the Breaching AD network, you would have seen that credentials are often found without compromising a domain-joined machine. Specific enumeration techniques may require a particular setup to work.<br /></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Windows vs Linux</span></p><p><i>"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer defeat."</i> - Sun Tzu, Art of War.<br /></p><p>You can get incredibly far doing AD enumeration from a Kali machine. Still, if you genuinely want to do in-depth enumeration and even exploitation, you need to understand and mimic your enemy. Thus, you need a Windows machine. This will allow us to use several built-in methods to stage our enumeration and exploits. In this network, we will explore one of these built-in tools, called the <code>runas.exe</code> binary.</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Runas Explained</span></p><p>Have you ever found AD credentials but nowhere to log in with them? Runas may be the answer you\'ve been looking for! </p><p>In security assessments, you will often have network access and have just discovered AD credentials but have no means or privileges to create a new domain-joined machine. So we need the ability to use those credentials on a Windows machine we control.</p><p>If we have the AD credentials in the format of &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;, we can use Runas, a legitimate Windows binary, to inject the credentials into memory. The usual Runas command would look something like this:</p><pre><code class="terminal-code">runas.exe /netonly /user:&lt;domain&gt;\\&lt;username&gt; cmd.exe</code></pre><p><span>Let\'s look at the parameters:</span></p><ul><li><span><b>/netonly</b> - Since we are not domain-joined, we want to load the credentials for network authentication but not authenticate against a domain controller. So commands executed locally on the computer will run in the context of your standard Windows account, but any network connections will occur using the account specified here.</span></li><li><span><b>/user</b> - Here, we provide the details of the domain and the username. It is always a safe bet to use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) instead of just the NetBIOS name of the domain since this will help with resolution.</span></li><li><span><b>cmd.exe</b> - This is the program we want to execute once the credentials are injected. This can be changed to anything, but the safest bet is cmd.exe since you can then use that to launch whatever you want, with the credentials injected.</span></li></ul><p><span>Once you run this command, you will be prompted to supply a password. Note that since we added the /netonly parameter, the credentials will not be verified directly by a domain controller so that it will accept any password. We still need to confirm that the network credentials are loaded successfully and correctly. </span></p><p><span><b>Note:</b> If you use your own Windows machine, you should make sure that you run your first Command Prompt as Administrator. This will inject an Administrator token into CMD. If you run tools that require local Administrative privileges from your Runas spawned CMD, the token will already be available. This does not give you administrative privileges on the network, but will ensure that any local commands you execute, will execute with administrative privileges.<br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">It\'s Always DNS</span></p><p><span><b>Note: </b>These next steps you only need to perform if you use your own Windows machine for the exercise. However, it is good knowledge to learn how to perform since it may be helpful on red team exercises.</span><span></span></p><p><span>After providing the password, a new command prompt window will open. Now we still need to verify that our credentials are working. The most surefire way to do this is to list SYSVOL. Any AD account, no matter how low-privileged, can read the contents of the SYSVOL directory.</span></p><p><span>SYSVOL is a folder that exists on all domain controllers. It is a shared folder storing the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and information along with any other domain related scripts. It is an essential component for Active Directory since it delivers these GPOs to all computers on the domain. Domain-joined computers can then read these GPOs and apply the applicable ones, making domain-wide configuration changes from a central location.</span></p><p><span>Before we can list SYSVOL, we need to configure our DNS. Sometimes you are lucky, and internal DNS will be configured for you automatically through DHCP or the VPN connection, but not always (like this TryHackMe network). It is good to understand how to do it manually. Your safest bet for a DNS server is usually a domain controller. Using the IP of the domain controller, we can execute the following commands in a PowerShell window:</span></p><pre><code class="language-powershell">$dnsip = "&lt;DC IP&gt;"\n$index = Get-NetAdapter -Name \'Ethernet\' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty \'ifIndex\'\nSet-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex $index -ServerAddresses $dnsip</code></pre><p><span>Of course, \'Ethernet\' will be whatever interface is connected to the TryHackMe network. We can verify that DNS is working by running the following:</span></p><div class="terminal-container">\n  <div class="terminal-content">\n      <div class="terminal-top">\n          Command Prompt\n      </div>\n      <pre class="terminal-code">         <code class="language-shell-session">C:\\&gt; nslookup za.tryhackme.com<br /></code></pre></div></div><p><span>Which should now resolve to the DC IP since this is where the FQDN is being hosted. Now that DNS is working, we can finally test our credentials. We can use the following command to force a network-based listing of the SYSVOL directory:</span></p><div class="terminal-container">\n  <div class="terminal-content">\n      <div class="terminal-top">\n          Command Prompt\n      </div>\n      <pre class="terminal-code">         <code class="language-shell-session">C:\\Tools&gt;dir \\\\za.tryhackme.com\\SYSVOL\\\n\xa0Volume in drive \\\\za.tryhackme.com\\SYSVOL is Windows\n\xa0Volume Serial Number is 1634-22A9\n\n\xa0Directory of \\\\za.tryhackme.com\\SYSVOL\n\n02/24/2022\xa0 09:57 PM\xa0\xa0\xa0 &lt;DIR&gt;\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 .\n02/24/2022\xa0 09:57 PM\xa0\xa0\xa0 &lt;DIR&gt;\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ..\n02/24/2022\xa0 09:57 PM\xa0\xa0\xa0 &lt;JUNCTION&gt;\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 za.tryhackme.com [C:\\Windows\\SYSVOL\\domain]\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 0 File(s)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 0 bytes\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 3 Dir(s)\xa0 51,835,408,384 bytes free</code></pre></div></div><p><span>We won\'t go too much in-depth now into the contents of SYSVOL, but note that it is also good to enumerate its contents since there may be some additional AD credentials lurking there.<br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">IP vs Hostnames</span></p><p><span><b>Question:</b> <i>Is there a difference between </i></span><i><code>dir \\\\za.tryhackme.com\\SYSVOL</code><span> and </span><code>dir \\\\&lt;DC IP&gt;\\SYSVOL</code></i><span><i> and why the big fuss about DNS?</i><br /></span></p><p><span>There is quite a difference, and it boils down to the authentication method being used. When we provide the hostname, network authentication will attempt first to perform Kerberos authentication. Since Kerberos authentication uses hostnames embedded in the tickets, if we provide the IP instead, we can force the authentication type to be NTLM. While on the surface, this does not matter to us right now, it is good to understand these slight differences since they can allow you to remain more stealthy during a Red team assessment. In some instances, organisations will be monitoring for OverPass- and Pass-The-Hash Attacks. Forcing NTLM authentication is a good trick to have in the book to avoid detection in these cases.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Using Injected Credentials</span></p><p><span>Now that we have injected our AD credentials into memory, this is where the fun begins. With the /netonly option, all network communication will use these injected credentials for authentication. This includes all network communications of applications executed from that command prompt window. </span></p><p><span>This is where it becomes potent. Have you ever had a case where an MS SQL database used Windows Authentication, and you were not domain-joined? Start MS SQL Studio from that command prompt; even though it shows your local username, click Log In, and it will use the AD credentials in the background to authenticate! We can even use this to <a href="https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/pth-attacks-against-ntlm-authenticated-web-applications/" target="_blank">authenticate to web applications that use NTLM Authentication</a>.<br /></span></p><p><span>We will be using that in the next task for our first AD enumeration technique.<br /></span></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 2, 'taskCreated': '2022-03-04T08:12:36.232Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'What native Windows binary allows us to inject credentials legitimately into memory?<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What parameter option of the runas binary will ensure that the injected credentials are used for all network connections?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>What network folder on a domain controller is accessible by any authenticated AD account and stores GPO information?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 4, 'question': '<p>When performing dir \\\\za.tryhackme.com\\SYSVOL, what type of authentication is performed by default?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}]}, {'taskTitle': 'Enumeration through Microsoft Management Console', 'taskDesc': '<p>You should have completed the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/jr/activedirectorybasics" target="_blank">AD Basics room</a> by now, where different AD objects were initially introduced.

Bloodhound is the most powerful AD enumeration tool to date, and when it was released in 2016, it changed the AD enumeration landscape forever. </p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Bloodhound History</span><br /></p><p>For a significant amount of time, red teamers (and, unfortunately, attackers) had the upper hand. So much so that Microsoft integrated their own version of Bloodhound in its Advanced Threat Protection solution. It all came down to the following phrase:</p><p><i>"Defenders think in lists, Attackers think in graphs." - Unknown</i><br /></p><p>Bloodhound allowed attackers (and by now defenders too) to visualise the AD environment in a graph format with interconnected nodes. Each connection is a possible path that could be exploited to reach a goal. In contrast, the defenders used lists, like a list of Domain Admins or a list of all the hosts in the environment. </p><p>This graph-based thinking opened up a world to attackers. It allowed for a two-stage attack. In the first stage, the attackers would perform phishing attacks to get an initial entry to enumerate AD information. This initial payload was usually incredibly noisy and would be detected and contained by the blue team before the attackers could perform any actions apart from exfiltrating the enumerated data. However, the attackers could now use this data offline to create an attack path in graph format, showing precisely the steps and hops required. Using this information during the second phishing campaign, the attackers could often reach their goal in minutes once a breach was achieved. It is often even faster than it would take the blue team to receive their first alert. This is the power of thinking in graphs, which is why so many blue teams have also started to use these types of tools to understand their security posture better.</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Sharphound</span></p><p>You will often hear users refer to Sharphound and Bloodhound interchangeably. However, they are not the same. Sharphound is the enumeration tool of Bloodhound. It is used to enumerate the AD information that can then be visually displayed in Bloodhound. Bloodhound is the actual GUI used to display the AD attack graphs. Therefore, we first need to learn how to use Sharphound to enumerate AD before we can look at the results visually using Bloodhound.</p><p>There are three different Sharphound collectors:</p><ul><li><b>Sharphound.ps1</b> - PowerShell script for running Sharphound. However, the latest release of Sharphound has stopped releasing the Powershell script version. This version is good to use with RATs since the script can be loaded directly into memory, evading on-disk AV scans.<br /></li><li><b>Sharphound.exe</b> - A Windows executable version for running Sharphound.</li><li><b>AzureHound.ps1</b> - PowerShell script for running Sharphound for Azure (Microsoft Cloud Computing Services) instances. Bloodhound can ingest data enumerated from Azure to find attack paths related to the configuration of Azure Identity and Access Management.</li></ul><p><b>Note: Your Bloodhound and Sharphound versions must match for the best results. Usually there are updates made to Bloodhound which means old Sharphound results cannot be ingested. This network was created using Bloodhound v4.1.0. Please make sure to use this version with the Sharphound results.</b><br /></p><p>When using these collector scripts on an assessment, there is a high likelihood that these files will be detected as malware and raise an alert to the blue team. This is again where our Windows machine that is non-domain-joined can assist. We can use the <code>runas</code> command to inject the AD credentials and point Sharphound to a Domain Controller. Since we control this Windows machine, we can either disable the AV or create exceptions for specific files or folders, which has already been performed for you on the THMJMP1 machine. You can find the Sharphound binaries on this host in the <code>C:\\Tools\\</code> directory. We will use the SharpHound.exe version for our enumeration, but feel free to play around with the other two. We will execute Sharphound as follows:<br /></p><p><code>Sharphound.exe --CollectionMethods &lt;Methods&gt;  --Domain za.tryhackme.com --ExcludeDCs</code><br /></p><p>Parameters explained:</p><ul><li>CollectionMethods - Determines what kind of data Sharphound would collect. The most common options are Default or All. Also, since Sharphound caches information, once the first run has been completed, you can only use the Session collection method to retrieve new user sessions to speed up the process.</li><li>Domain - Here, we specify the domain we want to enumerate. In some instances, you may want to enumerate a parent or other domain that has trust with your existing domain. You can tell Sharphound which domain should be enumerated by altering this parameter. </li><li>ExcludeDCs -This will instruct Sharphound not to touch domain controllers, which reduces the likelihood that the Sharphound run will raise an alert.<br /></li></ul><p>You can find all the various Sharphound parameters <a href="https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/sharphound-all-flags.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It is good to overview the other parameters since they may be required depending on your red team assessment circumstances. </p><p>Using your SSH PowerShell session from the previous task, copy the Sharphound binary to your AD user\'s Documents directory:</p><div class="terminal-container">\n  <div class="terminal-content">\n      <div class="terminal-top">\n          SSH PowerShell\n      </div>\n      <pre class="terminal-code">         <code class="language-markup">PS C:\\&gt; copy C:\\Tools\\Sharphound.exe ~\\Documents\\\nPS C:\\&gt; cd ~\\Documents\\\nPS C:\\Users\\gordon.stevens\\Documents&gt;</code></pre>We will run Sharphound using the All and Session collection methods:</div></div><p></p><div class="terminal-container">\n  <div class="terminal-content">\n      <div class="terminal-top">\n          SSH PowerShell\n      </div>\n      <pre class="terminal-code">         <code class="language-markup">PS C:\\Users\\gordon.stevens\\Documents\\&gt;SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethods All --Domain za.tryhackme.com --ExcludeDCs\n2022-03-16T19:11:41.2898508+00:00|INFORMATION|Resolved Collection Methods: Group, LocalAdmin, GPOLocalGroup, Session, LoggedOn, Trusts, ACL, Container, RDP, ObjectProps, DCOM, SPNTargets, PSRemote\n2022-03-16T19:11:41.3056683+00:00|INFORMATION|Initializing SharpHound at 7:11 PM on 3/16/2022\n2022-03-16T19:11:41.6648113+00:00|INFORMATION|Flags: Group, LocalAdmin, GPOLocalGroup, Session, LoggedOn, Trusts, ACL, Container, RDP, ObjectProps, DCOM, SPNTargets, PSRemote\n2022-03-16T19:11:41.8211318+00:00|INFORMATION|Beginning LDAP search for za.tryhackme.com\n[....]\n2022-03-16T19:12:31.6981568+00:00|INFORMATION|Output channel closed, waiting for output task to complete\nClosing writers\n2022-03-16T19:12:32.2605943+00:00|INFORMATION|Status: 2163 objects finished (+2163 43.26)/s -- Using 85 MB RAM\n2022-03-16T19:12:32.2605943+00:00|INFORMATION|Enumeration finished in 00:00:50.4369344\n2022-03-16T19:12:32.5418517+00:00|INFORMATION|SharpHound Enumeration Completed at 7:12 PM on 3/16/2022!

First, we will look at Node Info. Let\'s search for our AD account in Bloodhound. You must click on the node to refresh the view. Also note you can change the label scheme by pressing LeftCtrl.<br /></p><p align="center"><img alt="Bloodhound" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/a6e1af6f79653eeedb18ac9c3be7a038.png" /><br /></p><p align="left">We can see that there is a significant amount of information returned regarding our use. Each of the categories provides the following information:</p><ul><li><b>Overview</b> - Provides summaries information such as the number of active sessions the account has and if it can reach high-value targets.<br /></li><li><b>Node Properties</b> - Shows information regarding the AD account, such as the display name and the title.<br /></li><li><b>Extra Properties</b> - Provides more detailed AD information such as the distinguished name and when the account was created.<br /></li><li><b>Group Membership</b> - Shows information regarding the groups that the account is a member of.<br /></li><li><b>Local Admin Rights</b> - Provides information on domain-joined hosts where the account has administrative privileges.<br /></li><li><b>Execution Rights</b> - Provides information on special privileges such as the ability to RDP into a machine.<br /></li><li><b>Outbound Control Rights</b> - Shows information regarding AD objects where this account has permissions to modify their attributes.<br /></li><li><b>Inbound Control Rights</b> -\xa0 Provides information regarding AD objects that can modify the attributes of this account.</li></ul><p>If you want more information in each of these categories, you can press the number next to the information query.

These are queries that the creators of Bloodhound have written themselves to enumerate helpful information.</p><p align="center"><img alt="Bloodhound" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/247be9dc8f34b8de181516199b0664dd.png" /><br /></p><p>Under the Domain Information section, we can run the Find all Domain Admins query.

Let\'s take a deeper dive into what Bloodhound is showing us. There is an AD user account with the username of <b>T0_TINUS.GREEN</b>, that is a member of the group <b>Tier 0 ADMINS</b>. But, this group is a nested group into the <b>DOMAIN ADMINS</b> group, meaning all users that are part of the <b>Tier 0 ADMINS</b> group are effectively DAs. </p><p>Furthermore, there is an additional AD account with the username of <b>ADMINISTRATOR</b> that is part of the <b>DOMAIN ADMINS</b> group. Hence, there are two accounts in our attack surface that we can probably attempt to compromise if we want to gain DA rights. Since the <b>ADMINISTRATOR</b> account is a built-in account, we would likely focus on the user account instead.<br /></p><p>Each AD object that was discussed in the previous tasks can be a node in Bloodhound, and each will have a different icon depicting the type of object it is. If we want to formulate an attack path, we need to look at the available edges between the current position and privileges we have and where we want to go. Bloodhound has various available edges that can be accessed by the filter icon:</p><p align="center"><img alt="Bloodhound" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/c21ccdbdd84a6e709d39fdff14764cea.png" /><br /></p><p>These are also constantly being updated as new attack vectors are discovered. We will be looking at exploiting these different edges in a future network. However, let\'s look at the most basic attack path using only the default and some special edges. We will run a search in Bloodhound to enumerate the attack path. Press the path icon to allow for path searching.</p><p align="center"><img alt="Bloodhound" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/d3fab8519fda4ac61db80c35274c53a1.png" /></p><p>Our Start Node would be our AD username, and our End Node will be the <b>Tier 1 ADMINS</b> group since this group has administrative privileges over servers.</p><p><img alt="Bloodhound" style="width:100%" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/b7ae2e4f8e1824e25e69fa69d95c4a4e.png" /><br /></p><p>If there is no available attack path using the selected edge filters, Bloodhound will display "No Results Found". <b>Note, this may also be due to a Bloodhound/Sharphound mismatch, meaning the results were not properly ingested. Please make use of Bloodhound v4.1.0.</b> However, in our case, Bloodhound shows an attack path. It shows that one of the<b> T1 ADMINS, ACCOUNT,</b>\xa0 broke the tiering model by using their credentials to authenticate to <b>THMJMP1</b>, which is a workstation. It also shows that any user that is part of the <b>DOMAIN USERS</b> group, including our AD account, has the ability to RDP into this host. </p><p>We could do something like the following to exploit this path:</p><ol><li>Use our AD credentials to RDP into <b>THMJMP1</b>.</li><li>Look for a privilege escalation vector on the host that would provide us with Administrative access.</li><li>Using Administrative access, we can use credential harvesting techniques and tools such as Mimikatz.</li><li>Since the T1 Admin has an active session on <b>THMJMP1</b>, our credential harvesting would provide us with the NTLM hash of the associated account.</li></ol><p>This is a straightforward example. The attack paths may be relatively complex in normal circumstances and require several actions to reach the final goal. If you are interested in the exploits associated with each edge, the following <a href="https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html" target="_blank">Bloodhound documentation</a> provides an excellent guide. Bloodhound is an incredibly powerful AD enumeration tool that provides in-depth insights into the AD structure of an attack surface. It is worth the effort to play around with it and learn its various features.</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Session Data Only</span></p>The structure of AD does not change \nvery often in large organisations. There may be a couple of new employees, \nbut the overall structure of OUs, Groups, Users, and permission will \nremain the same. <p></p><p>However, the one thing that does change constantly is active sessions and LogOn events. Since Sharphound creates a point-in-time snapshot of the AD structure, active session data is not always accurate since some users may have already logged off their sessions or new users may have established new sessions. This is an essential thing to note and is why we would want to execute Sharphound at regular intervals.</p><p>A good approach is to execute Sharphound with the "All" collection method at the start of your assessment and then execute Sharphound at least twice a day using the "Session" collection method. This will provide you with new session data and ensure that these runs are faster since they do not enumerate the entire AD structure again. The best time to execute these session runs is at around 10:00, when users have their first coffee and start to work and again around 14:00, when they get back from their lunch breaks but before they go home.</p><p>You can clear stagnant session data in Bloodhound on the Database Info tab by clicking the "Clear Session Information" before importing the data from these new Sharphound runs.<br /></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Benefits</span></p><ul><li>Provides a GUI for AD enumeration.</li><li>Has the ability to show attack paths for the enumerated AD information.</li><li>Provides more profound insights into AD objects that usually require several manual queries to recover.</li></ul><p><span style="font-size:24px">Drawbacks</span></p><ul><li>Requires the execution of Sharphound, which is noisy and can often be detected by AV or EDR solutions.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p>', 'taskType': 'downloadable', 'taskNo': 6, 'taskCreated': '2022-03-04T15:04:44.018Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '62a04c1f0b589b00601dcab5', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'What command can be used to execute Sharphound.exe and request that it recovers Session information only from the za.tryhackme.com domain without touching domain controllers?<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>Apart from the krbtgt account, how many other accounts are potentially kerberoastable?<br /></p>', 'hint': 'Use the Per-Built Analytics Queries.'}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>How many machines do members of the Tier 1 Admins group have administrative access to?<br /></p>', 'hint': 'Search for the Tier 1 Admins group and enumerate its information.'}, {'questionNo': 4, 'question': '<p>How many users are members of the Tier 2 Admins group?<br /></p>', 'hint': 'Search for the Tier 2 Admins group and enumerate its information.'}]}, {'taskTitle': 'Conclusion', 'taskDesc': '<p>Enumerating AD is a massive task.

This is by no means an exhaustive list. Here is a list of enumeration techniques that also deserve mention:</p><ul><li><b><a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-ldap" target="_blank">LDAP enumeration</a></b> - Any valid AD credential pair should be able to bind to a Domain Controller\'s LDAP interface. This will allow you to write LDAP search queries to enumerate information regarding the AD objects in the domain.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1" target="_blank">PowerView</a></b> - PowerView is a recon script part of the <a href="https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit" target="_blank">PowerSploit</a> project. Although this project is no longer receiving support, scripts such as PowerView can be incredibly useful to perform semi-manual enumeration of AD objects in a pinch.</li><li><b><a href="https://0xinfection.github.io/posts/wmi-ad-enum/" target="_blank">Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)</a></b> - WMI can be used to enumerate information from Windows hosts. It has a provider called "root\\directory\\ldap" that can be used to interact with AD. We can use this provider and WMI in PowerShell to perform AD enumeration.</li></ul><p>We should also note that this room focussed on enumerating the structure of the AD domain in its entirety instead of concentrating only on identifying misconfigurations and weaknesses. Enumeration focused on identifying weaknesses, such as insecure shares or breaks in the tiering model, will be discussed in future rooms.<br /></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Mitigations</span></p><p>AD enumeration is incredibly hard to defend against. Many of these techniques mimic regular network traffic and behaviour, making it difficult to distinguish malicious traffic from normal traffic. However, there are a couple of things that we can do to detect potentially malicious behaviour:</p><ul><li>Powerful AD enumeration techniques such as Sharphound generate a significant amount of LogOn events when enumerating session information. Since it executes from a single AD account, these LogOn events will be associated with this single account. We can write detection rules to detect this type of behaviour if it occurs from a user account.</li><li>We can write signature detection rules for the tools that must be installed for specific AD enumeration techniques, such as the SharpHound binaries and the AD-RSAT tooling.</li><li>Unless used by employees of our organisation, we can monitor the use of Command Prompt and Powershell in our organisation to detect potential enumeration attempts from unauthorised sources.</li></ul><p>On a side note, the blue team themselves can also regularly use these enumeration techniques to identify gaps and misconfigurations in the structure of the AD domain. If we can resolve these misconfigurations, even if an attacker enumerates our AD, they would not be able to find misconfigurations that can be exploited for privilege escalation or lateral movement.<br /></p>Now that we have enumerated AD, the next step is to perform privilege escalation and lateral movement across the domain to get into a suitable position to stage attacks.
