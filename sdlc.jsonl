SDLC defines the tasks to perform at each software development stage. This methodology aims to improve the quality of the software and the development process to exceed customer expectations and meet deadlines and cost estimates. For example, with customer demand, computing power increases, which raises software costs and developer dependence. SDLC provides a way to measure and improve the development process by providing insights and analysing each stage, maximising efficiency and reducing costs.<br /></p><p><span style="font-size:24px"><span class="ct-span oxy-stock-content-styles" style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-size:24px">How does SDLC work?</span></span></span></p><p>The \nSoftware Development Life Cycle provides the guidance required to create a software application. It does this by splitting these tasks into phases that form the Software Development Lifecycle. Standardising\xa0the tasks within each phase increases the efficiency of the development process. Each phase divides into granular tasks that can be measured and tracked. This introduces the capability of monitoring to ensure projects stay on track. The aim of SDLC is to establish repeatable processes and predictable outcomes from which future projects can benefit.

Planning</span></h3><p>As part of the Planning Phase, also known as the Feasibility Stage, the scope and purpose of the application are determined. Software development <img style="float:right" class="note-float-right" />is planned and implemented using it. Additionally, it helps to keep the project focused on its original purpose while setting boundaries. Here, the<img /> <img alt class="note-float-right" style="float:right" />system\'s problem and scope are defined, and the requirements for its upcoming design can be determined. The process of devising an effective outline for the forthcoming development cycle should enable issues to be caught before they have a detrimental effect on the process. And help them identify the resources they need to make their plan happen. The planning stage can be crucial if the goal is to have a product ready for market by a specific date.</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">2. Requirements Definition</span></p><p><span style="font-size:1rem">A system\'s requirements stage involves defining the prototype ideas and gathering all the necessary details.

An application that uses social media, <img alt class="note-float-left" style="float:left" /><img alt class="note-float-left" style="float:left" />for example, will require you to connect with a friend or in some inventory programs, there is a search feature. Defining the resources needed to build the project according to the requirements is also critical. For example, software might be developed to control a custom manufacturing machine. A device is required for the process. It is common for developers to produce a document known as a software requirement specification (SRS).</span></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">3. Design and Prototyping</span></p><p><span style="font-size:1rem">It is first necessary for developers to outline the details of the overall application, including its attributes, such as:</span><br /></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:1rem">Interfaces for users</span><br /></li><li><span style="font-size:1rem">Interfaces between systems</span><br /></li><li><span style="font-size:1rem">Requirements for networks</span><br /></li><li><span style="font-size:1rem">Instances of databases</span><br /></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:1rem">SRS documents are usually converted into logical structures implemented in programming languages.

Testing</span></h3><span style="font-size:24px">\n</span><span style="font-size:16px"></span></span></h3></span><p>\ufeffIt\'s critical to test an application before making it available to users. During the testing stage, developers will review their software using automated tooling, like source code scanners. The project\'s goal is to meet the previously defined quality standards during the planning and requirement stages. Testing is an essential pillar in moving toward a more Secure Development Lifecycle. To introduce testing effectively in the SDLC, it has to go through its own "Software Testing Lifecycle" phases. Sometimes, there are dedicated teams as part of a testing function. For example, a Quality Team with Quality Analysis (QA) Engineers. The most notable phases when introducing testing are test case design and development, test environment set up and test execution.<br /><br /><b>Test case design and development</b><br />With the test plan in place, testers can begin writing and creating detailed test cases. In this phase, the QA team fleshes out the details of the structured tests they will run, ensuring that it meets the requirements set in the previous SDLC phases. When conceptualising test cases, the tester\'s goal should be to validate functionality within the allotted time and scope, especially core functionality. Test cases should be simple, well understood by any team member, and unique from other test cases. Test cases must be identifiable and repeatable, as developers will add new functionality to the product over time, requiring tests to run again. They can\'t change the test environment for future tests, especially when validating configurations. Test cases might also require maintenance or updates over time to validate both new and existing functionality. Once test cases are ready, a test team lead or peer can review them or check and update automated test scripts. <br /></p><p><br /><b>Test environment setup</b><br />The test environment provides the setting where the actual testing occurs. Testers must access bug reporting capabilities and the application architecture to support the product. Once ready, testers establish the test environment\'s parameters, including the hardware, software, test data, frameworks, configurations and network. For example, most of a product\'s users might be on an Android device, use a specific version of a Chrome browser and have a certain amount of processing power on those devices. These are parameters the test environment would include. <br /></p><p><br /><b>Test execution</b><br />At this stage, testers execute all test cases. For example, QA engineers and automated scripts run several functional and non-functional tests. Testers will identify and report detailed bugs from test case execution and log the system\'s performance compared to its requirements. Often testers retest the product, as part of regression testing, as developers make fixes to ensure new flaws don\'t get into production. With all of these tests piling up in the test execution phase, it\'s essential to use test automation to achieve the test coverage and velocity you need. Developer velocity is a metric that helps us understand and estimate how much development our team can perform in a given timeframe.<br /></p><p><span class="ct-span oxy-stock-content-styles"></span></p><h3><span style="font-size:24px">6. Deployment</span></h3>After testing, the overall design for the software \nstarts to come \ntogether, and different modules or configurations are integrated into \nthe \nprimary source code. After this stage, the software is \ntheoretically ready for market and provided to end-users. Many companies\n automate the deployment phase using tools we will later see in the \nDevSecOps pathway. These tools focus on what you call "Software \nDeployment tools" for release management; the focus is on automating \nsoftware rollouts so that teams can deploy new applications on all \nmachines or just selected ones. This is particularly important if the \nnew package requires actions to deploy correctly (a reboot of the \nmachine, for example). Popular Software Deployment tools are <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify </a>and<a href="https://argoproj.github.io/cd/" target="_blank"> Argo CD</a>.\n During the deployment phase, a new feature on the company\'s website can\n be released, or in the case of mobile development, download a new \napplication version on a smartphone. Furthermore, automating the deployment processes also allows the capability to rollback a deployment, making it easier to go back if there are any unforseen circumstances with the deployment.<br /><p></p><span class="ct-span oxy-stock-content-styles">\n\n<h3><span style="font-size:24px">7. Operations and Maintenance</span></h3><span style="font-size:24px">\n</span><p>Developers must now move into maintenance mode and begin practising any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users. <span style="font-size:1rem">Furthermore, developers are responsible for implementing changes the software might need after deployment. </span><span style="font-size:1rem">In this phase, users discover bugs they didn\'t find during testing. For example, handling residual bugs that could not be patched before launch or resolving new issues raised during user reports.</span><span>\ufeff Developers now focus more on stability and uptime than developer velocity, and operations teams now have a stake in developer velocity and their traditional role of maintaining uptime. When it comes to the specific part of operations in DevOps, this often means:<br /></span></p><ul><li><span>They enable self-service for developers to promote developer velocity, where developers seek their solutions. Operations teams work closely with developers to provide on-demand access to secure, compliant tooling and environments.</span></li><li><span>They standardise tooling and processes across the business. The best way to enable a sustainable self-service model and empower teams to work autonomously is by standardising tooling. Tools and techniques that are standardised and well documented enable organisational unity and greater collaboration. This reduces the friction developers and operations teams experience when sharing responsibilities.</span></li><li><span>\xa0They are bringing extensible automation to traditional operations tasks. DevOps teams focus on empowering other teams through self-service and collaboration. Standard operations tasks like resolving incidents, updating systems, or scaling infrastructure still need to be addressed. When development and DevOps work closely together, teams automate the repeatable tasks and drive consistency across the organisation. DevOps teams can track and monitor metrics thanks to consistency and automation of tasks. For example, by automating the creation of virtual machines in the cloud through Terraform, you can log activity for virtual machines created and accessed. You can extend this further by creating alerts for how the service accounts/roles are used to develop infrastructure from a security and compliance point of view. As operations teams shift towards greater automation, \'X\' as code becomes the new normal. As example of this would be <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> or <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>. The code controlling operations systems must be stored, versioned, secured, and maintained. </span><span><br /></span></li></ul></span>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 4, 'taskCreated': '2022-03-10T22:51:20.887Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'What phase focuses on handling issues or bugs reported by end-users?<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What phase involves releasing new versions of software?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>What phase ensures software meets the standards defined in the requirements phase?<br /></p>', 'hint': ''}]}, {'taskTitle': 'Keep CALMS', 'taskDesc': '<p><span>\ufeff</span><span style="font-size:24px">Introduction</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px"><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/devops/frameworks/calms-framework" target="_blank">CALMS</a>, as explained in the Atlassian post, is a framework that assesses a company\'s ability to adopt DevOps processes. The acronym was coined by Jez Humble, co-author of "The DevOps Handbook," which stands for Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Culture<br /></span><span style="font-size:16px">As highlighted in the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/jr/introductiontodevsecops" target="_blank">Intro To DevSecOps</a> room,\xa0</span>DevOps isn\'t simply a process or a different approach to development; it\'s a culture change. For any DevOps adoption to be successful, an organisation will have to make a culture shift. Rather than the slower, full-release approach of the waterfall model, teams will have to adopt new strategies to break projects into smaller tasks that can be completed and then presented in a series of sprints. This culture shift is required for all employees, including not only the development teams but also QA, product management, and operations.<br /></p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Automation</span><span style="font-size:16px">\ufeff<br /></span>A large part of DevOps is the focus on automation. Since we are breaking projects into smaller components, it would be inefficient to then manually integrate these components into the final solution. Thus, it is better to spend some time creating automated processes that can ensure that new feature integrations can occur in a reliable and repeatable manner. This is usually started on the continuous delivery side of things for new teams. But as teams mature, it will also move to continuous integration.</p><p>Mature teams can also look to automate the configuration itself through tools such as configuration as code. This means that the configuration of the application itself is defined in code, which would alter build instructions depending on the environment that the application is being built for. This streamlines the process of building production-ready code, and configuration parameters could be used to reduce the verbosity of errors and remove developer bypasses before the code is built for the production environment.</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Lean<br /></span>By implementing DevOps, we want to make sure that tasks are broken as small as possible. This allows teams to create initial versions of applications sooner. The common principle is that we are constantly improving our software, but it is more valuable to get a version of our application in the hands of users earlier rather than having to wait years until the product is fully perfected. Thus, we start with a lean first version that is constantly improved with time. This method also allows our user base to provide feedback and a wishlist of features for the application. </p><span style="font-size:24px">Measurement</span><p><span style="font-size:1rem">When implementing DevOps, it is important to have some sort of measure of effectiveness. These metrics are important since they will help us make small changes to our processes and ensure that we are constantly improving. In the next task, we will elaborate on how DevOps handles measurement and essential metrics to seek constant improvement and monitoring.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-size:24px">Sharing</span><br /></span>In an effective DevOps pipeline, there is a shared responsibility for the overall application between all teams, including development and operations.

As seen in the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/jr/introductiontodevsecops" target="_blank">Introduction to DevSecOps</a> room, gaining common ground to build perspective and empathy is crucial for buy-in and instilling security.</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">DevOps Metrics</span></p><p>During the process of manually creating infrastructure, deployments are blocked. There may be too many errors in the live application, indicating that the security test automation needs to be improved or is taking too much computing power and time. Understanding how and where to find improvement requires metrics to measure your resources. Here are the essential metrics gathered by engineers and the questions it aims to answer:</p><ul><li>Meantime to production (<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/delivery/metrics.html" target="_blank">MTTP</a>). What is the turnaround time for newly committed source code?</li><li>Frequency of deployment. What is the frequency of deployment of releases? The average lead time. How long does it take to develop, build, test, and deploy a new feature?</li><li>Speed of deployment. A new release is deployed into production; how long does it take?</li><li>Deployment Agility. You can measure deployment agility by combining deployment speed and frequency.</li><li>Production failure rate. How often do failures occur in production?</li><li>MTTR stands for mean time to recover. What is the recovery time after a failure?</li></ul><p><span style="font-size:24px">MTTP</span></p><p>One critical DevOps metric to track is the mean time production. MTTP is the length of time between when a code change is committed and when it is in a deployed state. A pre-release test, for instance, is passed when all code requirements have been met. Test automation and working in small batches are good ways to improve MTTP time. Developers can receive fast feedback on the code they commit by following these practices, identifying flaws, and fixing them as quickly as possible.\xa0 \xa0</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Failure Rate</span></p><p>When a code change goes into production, a certain percentage of code changes require hot fixes or other remediation measures. It does not measure failures caught during testing and fixes before the code is deployed. The same practices that enable shorter MTTP times correlate with reducing change failure rates. All these practices make bugs much easier to identify and remediate. Tracking and reporting failure rates are essential for ensuring new code releases meet security requirements.</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Deployment frequency</span></p><p>Understanding how often new code is deployed into production is critical to DevOps\' success. Deployment frequency defers to MTTP as it measures when it\'s released into a pre-production staging environment and reserves "deployment" to refer to code changes released into production. Teams can deploy changes on-demand and often many times a day. The ability to deploy on-demand requires a deployment pipeline that incorporates automated testing and feedback mechanisms, as mentioned in the previous tasks, minimising the need for human intervention.\xa0</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">MTTR</span></p><p>When a partial or total service interruption occurs, the mean time to recovery (MTTR) is measured. Keeping track of this metric is crucial. If a failure occurs, a fix must be deployed as soon as possible, or the changes that caused the failure must be rolled back. In most cases, this involves monitoring system health continuously and alerting operations in the event of a failure. The operations team have the necessary processes, tools, and permissions to resolve incidents.\xa0</p><p><span style="font-size:24px">Communicating Risk</span></p><p>You can demonstrate improvement over time by measuring any of these, and you\'ll have the evidence to support the buy-in from the business and teams. Risk means very different across teams. For DevSecOps engineers, risk means the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and its impact on systems. Whereas for a DevOps engineer, a significant risk would be high rates of production failure, for example. By understanding other teams\' definitions of risk, a DevSecOps engineer can find common ground and better build a perception of security risk for other teams.</p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 6, 'taskCreated': '2022-04-22T14:35:51.643Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'What 2 metrics are used to measure deployment agility?', 'hint': 'Deployment ***** and *********'}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What is an essential rate for engineers in Production environments to know if code meets security requirements?</p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>What is the measurement for recovery time after a failure?</p>', 'hint': ''}]}, {'taskTitle': 'Production of the Droids', 'taskDesc': '<p><span>\ufeff</span><span style="font-size:24px">\ufeff</span><span style="font-size:24px">The Empire Expects Great SDLC</span></p>Now that we understand SDLC principles, it is time to put them to the test!
