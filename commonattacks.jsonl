For example, if an attacker wishes to obtain a victim\'s password, they <i>could</i> attempt to guess or brute-force the password — <i>or</i> they could <a href="https://youtu.be/opRMrEfAIiI?t=42" target="_blank">simply ask you</a>.</p><p><img style="float:left;padding:25px;width:15%" alt="Decorative image of a hacker with a phone and a computer" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/4044940b5b0b6596cba1851545b759d0.png" />Whilst the example linked above is relatively straightforward, social engineering attacks can become very complex and often result in an attacker gaining significant control over a target\'s life — both online and offline. Social engineering attacks are often multi-layered and escalate due to the snowball effect. For example, an attacker may start off by obtaining a small amount of publicly available information from a victim\'s social media presence, which they could then use to get more information from, say, your phone or broadband provider. The information obtained from the second stage could then be used to gain more useful information, then escalate step-by-step to something like the victim\'s bank account. </p><p>The best way to understand social engineering is to see it in action! These videos from <a href="https://youtu.be/fHhNWAKw0bY?t=100" target="_blank">Defcon23</a> (one of the largest hacking conferences in the world) and <a href="https://youtu.be/PWVN3Rq4gzw" target="_blank">CNN</a> demonstrate some of the immense power in social engineering. They are both well worth a watch!<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Other Forms of Social Engineering</span></b></p><p>Charismatic hackers calling your phone company and taking possession of your account is one form of social engineering; however, there are many <img style="float:right;width:20%;padding:20px" alt="Decorative image of a USB drive" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/e3eba5509524a8c1ac0f8b16e8c9e019.png" />other types. Social engineering is a <i>vast</i> topic, encompassing any attack that relies on tricking humans into giving the attacker access, rather than attacking the technology directly. Whilst direct interaction with targets is the most common style of social engineering, other examples include dropping USB storage devices in public (e.g. in company car parks) in the hope that someone (often a company employee) will pick one up and plug it into a sensitive computer. In a similar vein, attackers may leave a "charging cable" plugged into a socket in a public place. In actuality, the cable contains malicious software such as keyloggers or tools to take control of the victim\'s device.</p><div style="border-radius:15px;border:1px solid #020c54;background-color:rgba(201,207,255,0.8);width:80%;margin:0 auto;color:#020c54;padding:15px;margin-bottom:20px"><details><summary><u><i>Case Study: Stuxnet (Click to Read)<br /></i></u></summary><p><br />Stuxnet was the name given to a particularly nasty computer virus (allegedly developed by the governments of the United States and Israel) that was originally used to target the Iran nuclear programme in 2009. Due to its ability as a "worm" to self-replicate (i.e. clone itself across networks — including the internet), the virus escaped and became much more widespread than was intended. Multiple variants now also exist, making Stuxnet a particularly hard-hitting and notorious weapon. You can read more about the background of Stuxnet <a href="https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-center/threat-profiles/ics-malware-variants/stuxnet" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /></p><p>What makes Stuxnet particularly interesting for this section is the original method of infection. The virus can clone itself across networks, but that doesn\'t help much when the target network is a nuclear weapons development facility with no access to the wider internet. The question became: how can you get a virus into a network that doesn\'t let anything in or out? The answer was simple: drop malicious USB devices in places where workers at companies that dealt with the facility would find them and hope that one of them plugged the device into a work computer. In this case, the gamble worked, with Stuxnet causing severe damage to the Iran nuclear programme and effectively destroying many of the nuclear centrifuges.<br /></p></details></div><p>In short, the limits to social engineering are at the bounds of an attacker\'s imagination. A good social engineer can (and will) use a plethora of psychological tricks under any plausible context to "hack" their targets.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Staying Safe from Social Engineering Attacks</span><br /></b></p><p>In many ways, it is very tricky to stay safe from social engineering as it won\'t always be <i>you</i> who the attacker is talking to, but rather someone who can give them what they need without your consent (e.g. calling your bank whilst pretending to <i>be</i> you, so as to access your bank account). That said, there are still measures you can take to protect yourself from Social Engineering attacks:</p><ul><li>Always make sure to set up multiple forms of authentication, and ensure that providers respect these. For example, set difficult to guess — or otherwise incorrect — answers to security questions (making sure to store the answers somewhere safe!), and make sure that these questions are asked when you try to access accounts over the phone.</li><li>Never plug external media (e.g. USBs/CDs/etc) into a computer that you care about or that is connected to any other devices. Ideally, don\'t plug the media in at all, and instead give it to your local police for safekeeping.</li><li>Always insist on proof of identity when a stranger calls or messages you claiming to work for a company whose services you use. Where possible, confirm with a known phone number or email address that the call or message you received was legitimate (i.e. use a trusted method to get in contact with the company to confirm). Remember that no legitimate employee will ever ask for your password or other information that protects your account.<br /></li></ul>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 2, 'taskCreated': '2021-10-14T14:34:35.474Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'Read the task information and watch the attached videos<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>What was the original target of Stuxnet?<br /></p>', 'hint': 'Check the case study in the task'}]}, {'taskTitle': '<span class="badge badge-soft-warning size-16">Common Attacks</span> Social Engineering: Phishing', 'taskDesc': '<p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Overview</span></b></p><p>Phishing is one of the most common cyber attack types employed by scammers and bad actors, targeting individuals and businesses indiscriminately. In many cases, phishing is the initial attack vector used to gain access to a company\'s infrastructure before performing further attacks against the corporate network. Whilst there are many automated tools now available to help combat phishing threats, phishing is still one of the most prolific attack vectors around.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">What is Phishing?</span></b></p><p>Phishing is a sub-section of social engineering. Whereas social engineering is a very general term used to describe any attack that takes advantage of <img style="border-radius:40px;width:20%;padding:20px;float:right" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/1c0c3995d6cf973ea22b04bd313868fd.png" /> a human rather than a computer system, phishing specifically describes attacks whereby a scammer or other attacker tricks a victim into opening a malicious webpage by sending them a text message, email, or another form of online correspondence. Traditionally, "phishing" simply referred to emails; however, in the days of instant messaging, text messages, and voice/video calling, the term has evolved to blanket these other categories. These other forms are sometimes referred to individually as "smishing" — phishing over SMS — and "vishing" — phishing over voice chat — respectively. These attacks are very widespread (indeed, the chances of you <i>not</i> having been on the receiving end of such an attack are slim!) and are frequently deployed on massive scales using lists of leaked or stolen phone numbers and email addresses. </p><p>Phishing messages usually deploy psychological trickery (for example, inducing a false sense of urgency to make victims act rashly) and nearly always involve getting a victim to click on a link to a web application owned by the attacker. The victim is then often asked to enter sensitive information — for example, login details or credit card information — at which point the malicious site stores the information and the attack is complete. Alternatively, the victim may inadvertently install malware from the malicious page, thus giving an attacker an entry point into their device and network.</p><p>There are three primary types of phishing attacks:</p><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><b>Attack Type</b><br /></td><td><b>Definition</b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>General Phishing<br /></td><td>A simple, mass phishing attack which doesn\'t target anyone in particular, although they may aim for large groups (e.g. PayPal users, or Amazon customers). These large-scale campaigns are usually simple and are generally (but not always) fairly easy to spot as the messages and malicious sites are often not very well crafted and frequently contain many immediately visible errors.<br /></td></tr><tr><td>Spearphishing<br /></td><td>More targeted than general phishing, spearphishing aims for an individual or small group (e.g. employees of a specific company). Spearphishing campaigns are generally better crafted than the correspondence and malicious sites used in general phishing as they are designed to target a particular group, often as part of a more extensive campaign against the target. <br /></td></tr><tr><td>Whaling<br /></td><td>Even more specific than spearphishing, whaling targets high-value individuals (e.g. a C-Suite executive in a target company). The messages are generally extremely well crafted and tend to be very hard to spot.<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Be aware that you are much more likely to encounter a general phishing attack than a spearphishing or whaling attack in your day-to-day life. This may not be the case in your work life, however — especially if you are a high-ranking member of a company.<br /></p><p>An example of a popular general phishing scenario (or "pretext") would be receiving an email purportedly from "Amazon", informing you that your account has been used to buy a very costly item (e.g. the latest iPad). You are then provided with a link to view your purchase history. The link <i>looks</i> like it goes to <code>https://amazon.co.uk</code> but will actually take you to an attacker-controlled web application (that looks identical to the Amazon login page), asking you to enter your Amazon credentials. When you enter your credentials, you get redirected to the real Amazon orders page, where you find that there are no unauthorised purchases... yet. The attacker will then use your duly provided credentials to <i>actually</i> order expensive items with your account.</p><p>This process is shown in the following diagram:<br /></p><p><img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;width:60%" alt="Diagram showing the steps detailed below" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/50ba8566176fa1dbf7e7e90051fc94dd.png" /></p><ol><li>The attacker sends out a malicious phishing email campaign</li><li>Prospective victims receive the emails — some of them open the email and click the link</li><li>The victims enter their credentials into the attacker\'s fake web page</li><li>The web page stores the credentials or sends them directly to the attacker</li><li>The attacker uses the credentials to access the site, thus taking over the victims\' accounts<br /></li></ol><p>Phishing attacks work best when the malicious web page mimics an existing (usually well-known) web page. For this reason, attackers/scammers will usually use one of many freely available tools to simply clone an existing page, which can then be edited at their leisure.<br /></p><p>The end goal of a phishing attack can vary significantly depending on who is performing the attack. For example, a low-level scammer may simply be after sensitive information (e.g., bank details), whereas a high-powered group of malicious hackers may be targeting a specific organisation with the intention of causing further damage.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Identifying Phishing Attacks</span></b></p><p>Many generic phishing attacks are relatively easy to spot; they frequently have poor grammar and often do not address their victims by name (instead leaving the greetings generic — e.g., "Dear customer"). That said, other instances can be <i>extremely</i> difficult to spot, with some attacks being thorough enough to fool cybersecurity professionals. <br /></p><p><img style="float:left;padding:20px;width:15%" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/1eb2b04689c1986bb6ce593d355e3307.png" />Regardless of the attack type, in many cases, the pretext will be plausible — for example: the Amazon scam listed above, or a (fake) message from your "bank" telling you that there has been unusual activity with your account and to please log in to review it. This is especially true for spearphishing or whaling attacks where the pretext will be very carefully tailored to the target.</p><p>Equally, the domain name for the malicious site will usually be similar (but never identical) to the domain name used by the legitimate website. As a real-world example from 2021, a group of scammers sent out a mass phishing campaign over SMS, mimicking the British Royal Mail service and using the domain name <code>https://royalmai1.co.uk</code> (as opposed to <code>https://royalmail.co.uk</code>). By exchanging the final "<code>L</code>" for the number one, the scammers were able to successfully register a domain name that looked almost identical to the domain name of their cloned website; this is a very common tactic. </p><p>Also, bear in mind that HTML emails (effectively any email that looks fancy and contains formatting/graphics) can also be used to mask the real domain name in use. For example, the text in the email may be "<code>https://amazon.co.uk</code>"; however, the link <i>actually </i>goes to "<code>https://am4zon.co.uk</code>". You can see this by hovering your mouse over the link in a desktop application — the real link should appear at the bottom of the screen as in this graphic:</p><p><img alt="A fake email client showing the fake-server.thm redirect for an inline URL of onlinestore.thm" style="width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/6086a5f1f6a688a56f2c2be720acfc4d.png" />You can try this for yourself with the link below!</p><p><a href="https://shibes.xyz" target="_blank">https://tryhackme.com</a><br /></p><p>In a similar vein, the "From" email address in an email-based phishing campaign will often be suspicious. Many generic mass phishing campaigns will simply use Gmail addresses — not bothering to use a domain name associated with the company they are spoofing. This is a dead giveaway that the email is suspicious.<br /></p><p>The best way to identify a phishing email is simply to keep your eyes open and look for anything suspicious — all but the best will have a mistake <i>somewhere</i>.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Staying Safe from Phishing Attacks</span><br /></b></p><p>There are a variety of things that you can (and should!) do to keep yourself safe from phishing attacks:</p><ul><li>Delete unknown or untrusted emails without opening them. If you can see anything suspicious in the email, also report it as spam to your email provider, or forward it to your IT Security department if you received the email at work.<br /></li><li><i>Never</i> open attachments from untrusted emails — this includes any attachments from a legitimate contact that you were not expecting.</li><li><i>Do not</i> click on embedded links in emails or messages. Where possible, navigate to the real website in your web browser and access the content that way. If you absolutely <i>must</i> click on the link, ensure that the domain name is correct and that the link points to where you think it does.</li><li><i>Always</i> make sure that your device and antivirus software are up-to-date.</li><li>Avoid making your personal information (e.g. email address and phone number) public if possible. If you <i>must</i> publish personal details publicly, create a "burner" email address (a temporary address made for one purpose, then destroyed soon afterwards) for the occasion, then destroy it as soon as it is no longer required.</li></ul><p>It\'s worth noting at this point that anyone can fall for a phishing attack — especially a complex one that has been made to look very realistic. If you accidentally fall for one, don\'t panic! Make sure that you change any affected passwords immediately, and contact IT Services if the attack happens at work.<br /></p>', 'taskType': 'static-site', 'taskNo': 3, 'taskCreated': '2021-10-14T14:34:30.903Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '61682627437056aee225431c', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': 'Click the green "View Site" button at the top of this task if you haven\'t already done so.<br />', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>The static site will display a series of emails and text messages.

There are many different kinds of malware: we will be focussing on generic malware and ransomware specifically in this task.</p><p>Once installed, attackers commonly use malware to steal information, cause damage, or execute arbitrary commands on the infected system. Malware is often used to perform a set of tasks referred to as "Command and Control" (or C2/C&amp;C). C2 malware connects back to a waiting server and allows an attacker to control the infected system remotely, often incorporating many simple tasks such as keylogging as built-in parts of the malicious software.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Ransomware</span><br /></b></p><p>A specialised class of malware: ransomware is used to infect as many systems as possible, encrypting the data on the devices and holding it to ransom. If the victims pay the attackers within a set timeframe (usually via a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin), the data is <i>theoretically </i>returned.</p><p>Ransomware usually spreads by exploiting known vulnerabilities in commonly installed software (e.g. the Microsoft Windows operating system); it can be extremely fast-spreading once an infection begins, and can demand millions in ransom money. The goal of a ransomware attack is to infect as many systems as possible, then make as much data inaccessible as possible by encrypting it with a key known only to the attacker. Once the attack is complete, the malware usually displays a window that looks something like this:</p><p></p><div style="display:block;text-align:center;margin:0 auto"><img alt="Wannacry Instruction Window" style="width:50%" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/79e049176fa9ec2db8f47f5a730c21c8.png" /><p><i><span style="font-size:12px">Wannacry Instruction Window</span></i></p></div><p></p><p>This window gives the victims the time limit and instructions on how to pay, as well as a rundown on what exactly has happened to their data.

For example, an attacker may send a victim an email containing a Microsoft Word or Excel file that contains a malicious macro (code that is embedded inside the document set to run when a user opens the file). These will not run by default unless the user clicks the "Enable Content" button at the top of the screen to enable macros:</p><p></p><div style="display:block;text-align:center;margin:0 auto"><img style="width:50%" alt="Screenshot showing the Enable Content button at the top of the screen in Microsoft word when loading a file containing macros" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/14456cfe7394e9161032a7fb82ffdd9d.png" /><p><i><span style="font-size:12px">"Enable Content" button in Microsoft Word</span></i></p></div><p></p><p>However, there are situations in which a user may genuinely wish to execute macros, and a good attacker will capitalise on these pretexts to convince the victim to click the button.</p><p>Similarly, the attacker may send the file as a compiled <code>.exe</code>, a PDF, a <code>.ps1</code> PowerShell Script or <code>.bat</code> Batch script, an HTML application file (<code>.hta</code>), or even a <code>.js</code> JavaScript file to be executed by the JavaScript interpreter built into Windows.</p><p>In short, there are <i>many</i> different ways and formats in which an attacker can send code to a victim. Once the code is executed, the infection begins.</p><p>Alternatively, the attacker may exploit a vulnerability in public-facing infrastructure in a corporate environment (for example, a webserver), thus giving themselves an opening into the internal network and allowing them to start a larger attack, facilitated by malware.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Staying Safe</span></b></p><p>Staying safe from malware (and ransomware in particular) is best done with a combination of awareness and keeping things up to date! </p><ul><li>Always accept updates and patches when offered — especially in important software like operating systems.

We use passwords to protect everything, from our social media accounts to our banking applications. Unfortunately, despite their significant importance, it is still all-too-easy to create and use an insecure password, and even easier to take other actions that lower the overall security of the system. For example, even the most robust password in the world is useless if written on a whiteboard in full view of a web-camera — especially if the same password is used for more than one service.</p><p>This task will cover password security, as well as other measures you can take to strengthen your overall authentication security.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">What Makes A Strong Password?</span></b></p><p>Advice on what constitutes a strong password has changed over time. In the past, people were advised to choose complex passwords that were easy to remember, for example:</p><p><code>@Ed1nburgh#1988-2000!</code><br /></p><p><img style="float:right;width:15%;padding:20px" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/8a2cab3625d9671a1c4deb653f70a923.png" />The password above is a collection of lowercase and uppercase characters, including symbols and numeric digits. It is over eight characters long (making it almost impossible to attack by brute-force with our current level of technology) and is created using knowledge that is unlikely to be held by anyone other than the owner of the password. Importantly, it also doesn\'t conform to normal patterns\xa0 (using unusual symbols, exchanging only <i>some</i> characters of l33t speak, and containing a date range as opposed to a single date), making it harder to guess. For all intents and purposes, this is a traditionally strong password. That said, the personal connection means that this password could potentially still be made weaker through social engineering or in-depth information gathering on a target.<br /></p><p>Current best practices lean more towards length than complexity. For example:</p><p><code>Vim is _obviously_, indisputably the best text editor in existence!</code><br /></p><p>By using a pass<i>phrase</i> rather than a traditional password, the password is significantly longer whilst still retaining some of the more complex elements — despite not looking quite so obfuscated. This has the advantage of being easier to remember whilst still being incredibly difficult to brute-force.<br /></p><p>Ideally, however, you should use long, completely random passwords. For example:</p><p><code>w41=V1)S7KIJGPN,dII&gt;cHEh&gt;FRVQsj3M^]CB</code><br /></p><p>These take  millions of years to crack and are objectively the most secure option available. The drawback is usability; however, this is largely mitigated by using a <i>password manager</i>, which will be discussed in the next task.<br /><br /></p><p><span style="font-size:24px"><b>What Makes A Weak Password?</b></span></p><p>People often go for simple passwords that mean something to them, often following one of a few "simple" patterns. For example, a commonly used pattern is a name/location, followed by a year, followed by an exclamation mark. For example:</p><p><code>Gareth2012!<br /></code><br /></p><p>This is enough to satisfy most password complexity requirements (lowercase and uppercase characters, over eight characters, contains numerical digits and a symbol); however, it is trivial to guess if an attacker knows that you have a son called Gareth who was born in 2012. This kind of password is inherently extremely insecure.</p><p>In short, any password that could easily be guessed by someone who knows you relatively well (this includes an attacker looking at your social media) is a bad idea!</p><p>Equally, short passwords (especially those that don\'t contain any non-alphanumeric characters) are weak against brute-force attacks. We will look at this in more depth later in the task.<br /></p><p>Of equal importance to password strength is password reuse. You can have the strongest password in the world, but if you use it across numerous accounts and it gets leaked, an attacker can simply use the same strong password on all affected accounts. Equally, if you find out that your password has been exposed, you will have a <i>lot</i> of work to do changing all of your account passwords!<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Exposed Passwords</span></b></p><p>Unfortunately, not every service stores passwords securely (making it doubly important that you don\'t reuse passwords!).</p><div style="width:80%;border:1px solid #020c54;margin:0 auto;border-radius:15px;background-color:rgba(201,207,255,0.8);color:#020c54;padding:15px;margin-bottom:20px"><details><summary><u><i>Background Information: Safe Password Storage (Click to read)</i></u><b><br /></b></summary><br />When you sign up for an online account, the provider must store a copy of your password in order to validate it the next time you sign in; but this poses a huge problem: how can the passwords be stored securely? <p></p><ul><li>Storing the passwords as plain text (e.g. the same way you submit them) isn\'t an option as every password will instantly be leaked if the database is ever hacked. </li><li><i>Encrypting</i> the passwords is an improvement, but not by much. If the passwords are stored encrypted, then they can also be <i>decrypted</i> — an attacker simply has to obtain the key, and they can turn every encrypted password back into plaintext. Encrypting passwords was part of what made the <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/11/04/anatomy-of-a-password-disaster-adobes-giant-sized-cryptographic-blunder/" target="_blank">2013 Adobe breach</a> so serious.<br /></li><li>The industry-standard password storage method is referred to as <i>password hashing</i>. Password hashing (or simply "hashing") involves using complicated mathematical algorithms to take any input and turn it into a unique, fixed-length output in a way that is impossible to reverse. This means that when you sign up, your password will be hashed and stored in the database in a way that stops everyone (including server administrators) from being able to read it! <br />When you try to sign in, the same algorithm is applied to the password that you supply: if the stored hash matches the hash of the password you are trying to log in with (remembering that the same input will always create the same unique output), then you are considered to have successfully authenticated.<br /></li></ul><p>Ideally, every service would hash user passwords with a secure algorithm. Even if the entire database were leaked, the attackers would still need to waste valuable time and computational power attempting to brute-force the (otherwise useless) hashes to find the plaintext passwords. This is why it is so important that passwords are long and preferably of a decent level of complexity: the longer the password and the larger the number of potential characters involved, the more power it takes to effectively <i>guess</i> the password input used to generate a hash.</p></details></div><p>So, what happens if a service gets hacked and their database containing user account information gets leaked? As a best-case scenario, the service has used a secure hashing algorithm, and you have a strong password — in this case, your password is safe, but your email address or username may still be leaked publicly (so expect some spam emails). <img style="float:right;padding:20px;width:15%" alt="Decorative image of a broken chain" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/0827b6623038fd1212eb12ab1ea255ee.png" /></p><p>As a worst-case scenario, your plaintext password is either immediately available, or is easy for an attacker to find. If this happens then both your username and password are known to the attacker, allowing them to take over your account or perform "credential stuffing" attacks — using your stolen username and password pair against other services to see if you reused them elsewhere. These leaked databases containing credentials frequently appear on the dark web, which leads us to our final point in this section: data exposure notification services.</p><p>The largest and most well-known data exposure checker is called "<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">Have I Been Pwned?</a>". It exists as a free online service that scours data dumps and catalogues all of the information found, allowing users to enter their email addresses to see if they have been included in any breaches. <i>Have I Been Pwned</i> also allows you to add yourself to a notification list, meaning that you will receive an email notifying you if your email address appears in any data breaches.</p><p>Whilst not a perfect defence, notification services give you a vital early warning to change your passwords (hopefully) <i>before</i> you get hacked.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Password Attacks</span></b><br /></p><p>An attacker has a few options when it comes to attacking passwords and authentication systems. Some attacks are entirely local (i.e. working entirely on a device owned by the attacker without interacting with the target service at all), others are remote attacks involving the original server.</p><p>Local attacks require a stolen copy of the credentials in question. The attacker will take a file full of stolen usernames/emails and hashed passwords, then use software to effectively try to guess the input that created the hash either using randomly generated sequences of characters (slower but more thorough) or by using a pre-generated wordlist of possible passwords (faster but much more likely to miss things). Hybrid types are also very widely used; these are when an attacker takes an existing wordlist and <i>mutates </i>it to add new characters, symbols, or random elements. Local password attacks will be demonstrated in the interactive element for this task.<br /></p><p>Remote attacks tend to be one of two categories; they either involve attempting to brute-force known usernames by sending requests to the server and seeing what it responds with, or they use known username and password pairs from previous breaches to see if they are valid on the target site — this is the aforementioned credential stuffing. </p>', 'taskType': 'static-site', 'taskNo': 5, 'taskCreated': '2021-10-14T14:35:37.643Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '61cf3d07437056aee2f324c5', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': '<p>Put yourself in the shoes of a malicious hacker.

The most common example of this is when you enter the password for an account, then get asked for a six-digit code that is sent to your phone and usually expires after fifteen minutes or so. This particular second authentication factor is referred to as a <b>T</b>ime-based <b>O</b>ne <b>T</b>ime<b> P</b>assword (or TOTP) and is one of the most common second factors currently in use.<br /></p><div style="border-radius:15px;border:1px solid #020c54;background-color:rgba(201,207,255,0.8);width:80%;margin:0 auto;color:#020c54;padding:15px;margin-bottom:20px"><details><summary><u><i>Background Information: Three Factors of Authentication (Click to Read)<br /></i></u></summary><p><br />There are three main factors that can be considered when implementing multi-factor authentication; these are:</p><p></p><ul><li>Something you <i>have</i> (e.g. a smart card, a TOTP, or a hardware authenticator such as a "<a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank">YubiKey</a>".

They <i>do</i> have access to a smartphone which can be used to receive or access time-based one time passwords. As such, mobile-based MFA is amongst the most common multi-factor authentication methods implemented for personal use. Whilst not ideal, two factors are better than one.<br /></p><p></p></details></div><p>You should always activate multi-factor authentication where available. Doing so means that an attacker must obtain more than one factor if they wish to compromise any of your accounts — for example, they must have both the password and your phone (or the ability to intercept your text messages). Many people see it as an "unnecessary hassle"; however, it is well worth it for the added security!</p><p>Unfortunately, SMS (text message) based TOTP authentication — despite being the most commonly used — is far from the most secure as there have been documented cases of attackers managing to reroute a victim\'s texts without undue difficulty<sup><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/can-we-stop-pretending-sms-is-secure-now/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>So, if not SMS then what? Time-based one-time passwords are still the most accessible form of second-factor authentication for most users; fortunately, it\'s possible to generate them yourself!</p><p>Most services will provide you with an option to use an "Authenticator App" for MFA. When you select this option, you will be presented with a QR code as well as a "secret key" — either of which can be scanned or imported into an app such as <a href="https://authy.com/" target="_blank">Authy</a> or Google Authenticator (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank">Android</a> | <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605" target="_blank">IOS</a>). Once you have added your secret key for the application, these apps can generate TOTP codes entirely on your device without requiring any network connectivity or interceptable SMS.<br /><br /></p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Password Managers and Generating Strong Passwords</span></b><p></p><p><img style="float:right;width:10%;padding:20px" alt="1Password logo" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/9b9eb96ff037c84f97d164ad45821ebd.png" />As mentioned previously, the most secure passwords are simply long, completely random strings of characters, digits, and symbols. Unfortunately, these random passwords are very difficult to memorise — indeed, memorising a different 60-digit, randomly generated password for every online account is simply not feasible for most people.</p><p>Enter: Password Managers.</p><p>At the most basic level, password managers provide a safe space to store your passwords. They store passwords in "vaults": encrypted storage either locally on your own device, or as an online service (which also usually allows you to access your passwords from any device). These vaults are accessed using a master password — the only password you need to remember —\xa0 or (more commonly in recent years) biometric data such as a fingerprint. Some password managers are free, whilst others require a paid subscription. That said, the features and usability provided by paid offerings often make them well worth the expense!<br /></p><p><img style="float:left;width:10%;padding:20px" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/5e5f7d9774935f71fd5546612b6db1c9.png" />The more fully-featured password managers usually also include a range of additional capabilities, such as storing other types of data (e.g. images, files, etc.), auto-filling passwords automatically for other services, and secure password generation. Having these features available means that you can quickly and easily generate very strong passwords and store them automatically, then seamlessly have the password entered for you when you attempt to log into an app, all within the same application.</p><p>Password managers are the recommended way to handle authentication for your many accounts; however, it is worth remembering that the security of the whole structure can revolve around a single master password, so make sure that it\'s solid!</p><p>Some common password managers include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a><br /></li><li><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a><br /></li><li><a href="https://keepass.info/" target="_blank">KeePass</a></li><li><a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank">Bitwarden</a><br /></li></ul><p></p><p>There are many others available!

As such, most public spaces (e.g. cafés, restaurants, public transport) are fully equipped with public WiFI to let people catch up on email (or, equally likely, play the latest hit mobile game). What many people <i>don\'t</i> realise is that expecting public WiFi to be available can prove to be very dangerous indeed. </p><p><img style="float:left;width:15%;padding:20px" alt="Decorative image of the wireless signal symbol" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/2712f95f3a5cfcd26e99e498fd477cc1.png" />Public WiFi, whilst incredibly handy, also gives an attacker ideal opportunities to attack other users\' devices or simply intercept and record traffic to steal sensitive information. This latter technique can be as simple as exploiting the fact that most people <i>expect</i> to see public networks available. The attacker can quickly set up a network of their own and monitor the traffic of everyone who connects; this is referred to as a "man-in-the-middle" attack and is very easy to carry out. For example, if you were to connect to a network belonging to an attacker then logged into an account for a website that doesn\'t use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, the attacker could simply pluck your credentials out of the network traffic and use them to log into your account for themselves. This scenario will be explored in more detail in the interactive element to this task; however, it is fortunately significantly less likely to occur with modern websites which implement <b>T</b>ransport <b>L</b>ayer <b>S</b>ecurity (TLS) to encrypt traffic between their servers and users as standard.</p><p>Equally, being connected to any network (regardless of whether you trust it or not) makes your device visible to others on the network.

Beneficial though public wireless connections are, it will always be safer to use a mobile hotspot or private network. Unfortunately, the ideal solution is not always feasible; when this is the case, we must rely on other methods of staying safe.</p><p><b>V</b>irtual <b>P</b>rivate <b>N</b>etworks (VPNs) encrypt all traffic leaving and re-entering your machine, rendering any interception techniques useless as the intercepted data will simply look like gibberish. Whilst it is possible to host your own VPN server for free, most people prefer to use one of the many online solutions. Some of these commercial solutions are free, but be warned: free VPNs tend not to provide the best security and often harvest your data themselves to make a profit. That said, the price of a good VPN is more than worth it for the increased safety when operating on untrusted networks. There are many good options around, including <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a> and <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/" target="_blank">Mullvad VPN</a>, to name two.<br /><br /></p><p><b><span style="font-size:24px">Website Connection Security</span><br /></b></p><p>In addition to the actions that you take to protect <i>yourself</i>, it is also important to be aware of the measures that online services take to protect you.</p><p>All websites should now only serve information in the safety of an encrypted connection. As with using a VPN, this prevents an attacker from reading, or modifying your web traffic if they intercept it. The encrypted connection used to create HTTPS (<b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol <b>S</b>ecure) is referred to as TLS (<b>T</b>ransport <b>L</b>ayer <b>S</b>ecurity), and in most browsers is represented by a padlock to the left of the search bar, which indicates that the connection is secure:</p><div style="display:block;text-align:center;margin:0 auto"><img alt="Picture of the TLS Padlock in Firefox, with the padlock circled in red" style="width:25%" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/63015ac57a167722ba94f28dbc85e323.png" /><p><i><span style="font-size:12px">TLS Padlock in Firefox</span></i></p></div><p>With this in place, your traffic can only be decrypted in very select circumstances: namely, if it is a work or school managed device and you are connected to a work/school network.</p><p><i><b>Note: </b>The presence of the padlock indicates that the connection is secure; it does <u>not</u> guarantee that the website itself is </i>safe<i>.
