The purpose of the container and the instructions set in a Dockerfile (we\'ll come onto this in a later task) determines what options we need to run the container with. To start, I\'ve put some of the most common options you may need to run your Docker container into the table below.</p><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><b>[OPTION]</b></td><td><b>Explanation</b></td><td><b>Relevant Dockerfile Instruction</b></td><td><b>Example</b></td></tr><tr><td>-d</td><td>This argument tells the container to start in "detached" mode. This means that the container will run in the background.</td><td>N/A</td><td><p><code>docker run -d helloworld</code></p></td></tr><tr><td>-it</td><td>This argument has two parts. The "i" means run interactively, and "t" tells Docker to run a shell within the container. We would use this option if we wish to interact with the container directly once it runs.</td><td>N/A</td><td><p><code>docker run -it helloworld</code></p></td></tr><tr><td>-v</td><td>This argument is short for "Volume" and tells Docker to mount a directory or file from the host operating system to a location within the container. The location these files get stored is defined in the Dockerfile</td><td>VOLUME</td><td><p><code>docker run -v /host/os/directory:/container/directory helloworld</code></p></td></tr><tr><td>-p</td><td>This argument tells Docker to bind a port on the host operating system to a port that is being exposed in the container. You would use this instruction if you are running an application or service (such as a web server) in the container and wish to access the application/service by navigating to the IP address.</td><td>EXPOSE</td><td><p><code>docker run -p 80:80 webserver</code></p></td></tr><tr><td>--rm</td><td>This argument tells Docker to remove the container once the container finishes running whatever it has been instructed to do.</td><td>N/A</td><td><p><code>docker run --rm helloworld</code></p></td></tr><tr><td>--name</td><td>This argument lets us give a friendly, memorable name to the container. When a container is run without this option, the name is two random words. We can use this open to name a container after the application the container is running.</td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p><code>docker run --name helloworld</code> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>These are just some arguments we can provide when running a container. Again, most arguments we need to run will be determined by how the container is built. However, arguments such as\xa0<code>--rm</code> and <code>--name</code> will instruct Docker on how to run the container. Other arguments include (but are not limited to!):</p><ul><li>Telling Docker what network adapter the container should use</li><li>What capabilities the container should have access to.

I will achieve this by using the <code>EXPOSE</code> instruction and telling the container to expose port <i>80</i>.</li><li>Tell the container to start the “apache2” service at startup. Containers do not have service managers like <code>systemd</code> (this is by design - it is bad practice to run multiple applications in the same container. For example, this container is for the apache2 web server - and the apache2 web server only).</li></ol><pre><code class="language-yml"># THIS IS A COMMENT\nFROM ubuntu:22.04\n\n# Update the APT repository to ensure we get the latest version of apache2\nRUN apt-get update -y \n\n# Install apache2\nRUN apt-get install apache2 -y\n\n# Tell the container to expose port 80 to allow us to connect to the web server\nEXPOSE 80 \n\n# Tell the container to run the apache2 service\nCMD ["apache2ctl", "-D","FOREGROUND"]</code></pre><p></p><p>For reference, the command to build this would be <code>docker build -t webserver .</code> (assuming the Dockerfile is in the same directory as where you run the command from). Once starting the container with the appropriate options (<code>docker run -d --name webserver -p 80:80\xa0 webserver</code>), we can navigate to the IP address of our local machine in our browser!</p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/95f7f4b43b7cdf6079a71a7a3e19f937.png" alt="The default landing page of apache2 which can be used to confirm that the service is running" /><br /></p><p style="text-align:center"></p><p style="text-align:center">The web server works!

Firstly, we need to ask ourselves why is it essential to optimise our Dockerfile? Bloated Dockerfiles are hard to read and maintain and often use a lot of unnecessary storage! For example, you can reduce the size of a docker image (and reduce build time!) using a few ways:</p><ol><li>Only installing the essential packages. What’s nice about containers is that they’re practically empty from the get-go - we have complete freedom to decide what we want.</li><li>Removing cached files (such as APT cache or documentation installed with tools). The code within a container will only be executed once (on build!), so we don’t need to store anything for later use.</li><li>Using minimal base operating systems in our <code>FROM</code> instruction. Even though operating systems for containers such as Ubuntu are already pretty slim, consider using an even more stripped-down version (i.e. <code>ubuntu:22.04-minimal</code>). Or, for example, using Alpine (which can be as small as 5.59MB!).</li><li>Minimising the number of layers - I’ll explain this further below.</li></ol><p>Each instruction (I.E. <code>FROM</code>, <code>RUN</code>, etc.) is run in its own layer. Layers increase build time! The objective is to have as few layers as possible. For example, try chaining commands from\xa0<code>RUN</code> together like so:</p><p><b>Before:</b></p><pre><code class="language-yml">FROM ubuntu:latest\nRUN apt-get update -y\nRUN apt-get upgrade -y\nRUN apt-get install apache2 -y\nRUN apt-get install net-tools -y</code></pre><div class="terminal-container">\n    <div class="terminal-content">\n        <div class="terminal-top">A terminal showing five layers of a Dockerfile being built<br /></div>\n        <pre class="terminal-code">           <code class="language-shell-session">cmnatic@thm:~$ docker build -t before .\n--omitted for brevity--\nStep 2/5 : RUN apt-get update -y\n ---&gt; Using cache\n ---&gt; 446962612d20\nStep 3/5 : RUN apt-get upgrade -y\n ---&gt; Running in 8bed81c695f4\n--omitted for brevity--\ncmnatic@thm:~$</code>\n        </pre></div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p><p><b>After:</b></p><pre><code class="language-yml">FROM ubuntu:latest\nRUN apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade -y &amp;&amp; apt-get install apache2 -y &amp;&amp; apt-get install net-tools</code></pre><div class="terminal-container">\n    <div class="terminal-content">\n        <div class="terminal-top">\n            A terminal showing two layers of a Dockerfile being built</div>\n        <pre class="terminal-code">           <code class="language-shell-session">cmnatic@thm:~$ docker build -t after .\nSending build context to Docker daemon   4.78MB\nStep 1/2 : FROM ubuntu\n ---&gt; 2dc39ba059dc\nStep 2/2 : RUN apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade -y &amp;&amp; apt-get install apache2 -y &amp;&amp; apt-get install net-tools\n ---&gt; Running in a4d4943bcf04\n--omitted for brevity--\ncmnatic@thm:~$</code>\n        </pre></div></div><p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/743dd22bcf1f3a709ee6288d519d5930.png" alt="An illustration showing that the commands have been compressed into two layers." /><br /></p><p>Note here how there are now only two build steps (this will be two layers, making the build much quicker).

When you install Docker, there are two programs that get installed:</p><ol><li>The Docker Client</li><li>The Docker Server</li></ol><p>Docker works in a client/server model. Specifically, these two programs communicate with each other to form the Docker that we know and love. Docker achieves this communication using something called a socket. Sockets are an essential feature of the operating system that allows data to be communicated.\xa0</p><p>For example, when using a chat program, there could be two sockets:</p><ol><li>A socket for storing a message that you are sending</li><li>A socket for storing a message that someone is sending you.</li></ol><p>The program will interact with these two sockets to store or retrieve the data within them! A socket can either be a network connection or what is represented as a file. What\'s important to know about sockets is that they allow for Interprocess Communication (IPC). This simply means that processes on an operating system can communicate with each other!</p><p> In the context of Docker, the Docker Server is effectively just an API. The Docker Server uses this API to <b>listen </b>for requests, whereas the Docker Client uses the API to <b>send</b>\xa0requests.</p><p>For example, let\'s take this command: <code>docker run helloworld</code>. The Docker Client will request the Docker server to run a container using the image "helloworld". Now, whilst this explanation is fairly basic, it is the essential premise of how Docker works.</p><p>Let\'s look at the following diagram to show this process in action:</p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/7ef5f80912c890645b102b28a23b9b8b.png" alt="illustrating the flow of Docker interaction using the docker.sock file on the operating system" /></p><p>What\'s interesting is that because of this, we can interact with the Docker Server using commands like <code>curl</code> or an API developer tool such as Postman. Now, using this is out of the scope for this room, but I\'ll demonstrate communicating with the Docker Server using Postman to list all images that are stored on the operating system:</p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://resources.cmnatic.co.uk/TryHackMe/rooms/docker-rodeo/dockerregistry/catalog1.png" style="width:497.997px" alt="the list of Docker images on an operating system captured using postman" /></p><p style="text-align:left">Finally, it\'s important to note that because of this, the host machine running Docker can be configured to process commands sent from another device. This is an extremely dangerous vulnerability if it is not correctly configured because it means someone can remotely stop, start, and access Docker containers.
