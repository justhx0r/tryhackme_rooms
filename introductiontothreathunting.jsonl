In its most basic form, that is the definition of Threat Hunting; however, in order for us to really understand what it entails as well as what its actual role is in the organisation, we will start by contrasting it with Incident Response.</p><ul>\n</ul><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:24px">Threat Hunting in Contrast with Incident Response</span></p><ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</ul>\n<p></p><p style="text-align:justify">Incident Response (IR) is innately reactive. The action, or “response”, is triggered by an initial notification or alert. This initial notification is first triaged, then analysed, and when enough pieces of evidence point to malicious activity, it is deemed an incident that needs to be responded to and dealt with accordingly.</p><p style="text-align:justify">More information about Incident Response, particularly the initial stages of it, is discussed in the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/preparation" target="_blank">Preparation Room</a> of the IR Module.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">Threat Hunting, on the other hand, is innately proactive. There is no actual ‘trigger’ that would mobilise a hunt, except for the pursuit of building the strength of the organisation’s security posture, guided by Threat Intelligence.</span><br /></p><p style="text-align:justify">A stark contrast can be seen here - while both are guided by the goal of ensuring the security of the organisation, the forces that drive the reactive and proactive nature of Incident Response and Threat Hunting, respectively, hardly share the same direction. This is further steered by the specific objectives that each aims to achieve.</p><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><b>Reactive Approach</b></td><td><b>Proactive Approach</b></td></tr><tr><td>Incident Response</td><td>Threat Hunting</td></tr><tr><td>Triggered by an initial notification / alert</td><td>Active search for suspicious events that can become incidents</td></tr><tr><td>Guided by the initial scope of the incident</td><td>Guided by Threat Intelligence</td></tr><tr><td>"There\'s a threat that needs to be dealt with now."</td><td>"There might be a threat that we don\'t know yet."</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:1rem">Usually, organisations start doing threat hunts when there’s already an established IR process as well as detection mechanisms in place, but they think that incidents aren’t being detected early enough.\xa0In the case of advanced threats, or even well-made red team exercises, there will always exist ways to go through your organisation undetected.</span><br /></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">Threat Hunting aims to bridge this gap, constantly finding ways to add and improve the current detection mechanisms in place so that future similar bad behaviour will automatically be detected immediately. More so, during that process, detected threats go immediately to the Incident Response team. The trigger for their mobilisation are the findings from the Threat Hunt, and consequent findings from the IR process may steer the Threat Hunting team to further find bad\xa0</span><span style="font-size:1rem">behaviour</span><span style="font-size:1rem">.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">This classic example shows the beauty of the synergy between two seemingly different approaches to ensuring one specific goal is met - strengthening the organisation’s security posture.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Synergy Diagram Between IR and Threat Hunting" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/2f47a4116acd75308c01626af6a50c64.svg" /><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><br /></span></span></p>', 'taskType': 'none', 'taskNo': 2, 'taskCreated': '2023-06-17T10:52:27.455Z', 'taskDeadline': None, 'tasksInfo': [], 'uploadId': '', 'questions': [{'questionNo': 1, 'question': "What do you call the approach to finding cyber security threats where there's an active effort done to look for signs of malicious activity?", 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 2, 'question': '<p>In this task, what are we contrasting threat hunting with?</p>', 'hint': ''}, {'questionNo': 3, 'question': '<p>Incident response is innately reactive.

It’s easy to rely on the most cutting-edge pieces of technology being offered out there, but across the industry, people would always be the most important part of any security team. And so, while thinking of equipping ourselves with the best tools is important, investing time (and probably money) in learning the proper mindset is as significant.\xa0</span><br /></p><ul>\n</ul><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:24px">What\'s the basis for our hunt?</span></p><p style="text-align:justify">It is imperative that we start our hunt with leads comprised of accurate pieces of information such as known relevant malware as well as trusted Threat Intelligence. Through leads, we give threat hunters better chances of achieving amazing things, from easy wins like looking for malicious binaries to more complex hunting projects like finding patterns of activity of certain groups that target organisations similar to us or industries we’re part of.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:22px">Threat Intelligence</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">Since we’re talking about dictating the direction of a hunt, it’s essential that we arm ourselves with critical information that will let us know more about the threat(s) that we may be dealing with. Understanding the bad that we may be dealing with is akin to knowing how they might behave within our environment, possibly allowing us to narrow down our search to specific sweet spots such as specific pieces of data they might be interested in, or even knowing which groups or APTs might be particularly interested in targeting us.</span><br /></p><ul>\n\n\n</ul>\n<p></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Unique Threat Intelligence</span></p><ul>\n\n</ul>\n<p></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">Intelligence on threats that you are able to develop internally is a very valuable asset to have. Not many organisations have the kind of intrusion experience that would allow them to study and develop usable intelligence from said intrusion and even fewer have the capability of developing it internally. Furthermore, intelligence of this kind may have the characteristic of being ultimately unique to your organisation.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) specifically documented on previous intrusions would be the most obvious and straightforward example for this one. IOCs immediately give value not only to your threat hunters but also to your detection mechanism, as they’re actual traces of an adversary. Through this, re-intrusions of that specific adversary or other adversaries that employ the same tactics would be easier to spot.</span></span><br /></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px">Threat Intelligence Feeds</span></p><ul>\n\n</ul>\n<p></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">As touched upon above, not a lot of organisations are capable of developing valuable and actionable Threat Intelligence internally. While a lot of organisations have their fair share of intrusions, not everyone has that kind of experience under their belt which allows them a front-row seat to a specific adversary’s IOCs, among others. More so, it involves a lot of money, skill, and effort to be able to become an efficient Threat Intelligence producer.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">It is not the end for the rest of us, as we can learn from other Threat Intelligence producers via Threat Intelligence feeds. There exist intelligence feeds that are both readily and publicly available. One of the most popular examples of this one is the MISP, an open-source Threat Intelligence and sharing platform. You may learn more about <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/misp" target="_blank">MISP here</a>.</span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">On the other hand, there are also paid resources that specialise in producing intelligence, some of which are capable of creating tailored intelligence for your organisation.

One example of leveraging this kind of intelligence is to take a closer look at your organisation, identify the relevant threat actors that might take an interest in you, and hunt for traces of the malware that they use in their toolkits within your organisation.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">The example above may be a bit general.

A lot of attack residues blend well with normal environmental noise. Pair this with a more advanced adversary who knows how to clean up after themselves or even worse - employ tactics that are already stealthy from the get-go, and the hunt is suddenly not as straightforward as it seems.</span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">Overall, it’s still a good way to cover our bases; remember that we only need to catch them making a mistake once while they need to constantly be perfect in their movements.</span></span></span><span style="font-size:22px"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:22px">Known Vulnerabilities of Products/Applications Being Used</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">Threat actors are quite creative in finding vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the products and applications that their target organisation use.

This is done most effectively via Attack Signatures and IOCs.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">By condensing the “whats” of the hunt down to Attack Signatures and IOCs, we suddenly have a set of information that we can then immediately compare to our available historical data. This makes it easier to find objects of interest such as relevant malware, attack residues, and even exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that we do need to know how the environment behaves and consequently, what the logs would look like when said vulnerability has been exploited.</span></span><span style="font-size:18px"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:22px">Logical queries</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="notion-enable-hover" style="fill:rgb(68, 131, 97)">Some hunting projects are best accomplished via logical queries.

There will never be a shortage of malicious actors, from Script Kiddies to well-funded Advanced Persistent Threats.

In that sense, similar kinds of activities are essentially undetectable; however, they are not invisible. It’s just that detection mechanisms haven’t yet been developed to automatically flag these activities.</p><p>It is through Threat Hunting that we’re able to find these activities, and upon such discovery, it will consequently (and quite immediately) trigger an Incident Response. These learnings will ultimately be fed back to the continuous monitoring process of the SOC (see last section).</p><p><img alt="Comic Panel 3" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/0f0e3e6f19e6a3510ab6327d48486cda.svg" /><br /></p><ul>\n</ul><p><span style="font-size:24px">Minimise the Dwell Time of Attackers</span></p><ul>\n\n\n</ul>\n<p></p><p>Another byproduct of undetected threat actor activity is having essentially a \'free pass\' to further snoop around within the environment.

With a deeper understanding of the environment, an attacker may execute more sophisticated ways of persisting within the environment, cause bigger damage to important assets and/or information, and steal more data.</p><p>The primary goal of Threat Hunting is to minimise a threat actor\'s dwell time. Ultimately, security is the business of ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organisation’s assets, and minimising dwell time also minimises the damage a threat actor might have already caused.</p><p><img alt="Comic Panel 4" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/4c5eaf97bc0d7a2f2279111f9193fc7a.svg" /><br /></p><ul>\n</ul><p><span style="font-size:24px">Develop Additional Detection Methods</span></p><ul>\n\n</ul>\n<p></p><p>In the end, we want to be able to use all of these findings as feedback to our continuous monitoring process.
