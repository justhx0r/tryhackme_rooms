Let\'s not dive deep into streams, just keep in mind that I said it in contrast with "orientation with input stream". You can\'t call vi stream oriented, because it doesn\'t work with neither of input or output stream.

So if that script has to run it will run with the root privileges. What we could do is make the files in that directory in flag format, that tar could interpret as it\'s flag. So when in our case, tar would start scanning the directory to get the overview of the files to compress and combine them, it will interpret those flags and will give us root shell. </span></p><p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:1rem">Awesome technique. Isn\'t it? Well that\'s not the point. The point here is, I found a little difficulty in creating those files (via command line) with -- appended to them. I tried xargs but didn\'t work. I then found an article <a href="https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/" target="_blank">here</a>, which helped me and I solved the challenge. Then when I started with the 5th phase of hacking(Covering Tracks). I couldn\'t seem to delete those earlier created </span><code>--checkpoint</code><span style="font-size:1rem"> files with </span><code>rm</code><span style="font-size:1rem">. I tried for an hour or so, but couldn\'t and left. Well, I didn\'t knew this, until I started reading documentations and man pages. Call it an instinct or just luck that I found a way to <i>escape command line flags as a positional argument</i>. Why all this theory, when I can simply get to this point? Well, I believe that it\'s just a better way of learning, when you can append your learnings with an event that had previously occurred. So later, I was able to remove the files using the following command.</span></p><p style="text-align:center"><code>rm -- --checkpoint=1</code><span style="font-size:1rem"></span></p><p style="text-align:center"><code>rm -- --checkpoint-action=exec=sh</code><span style="font-size:1rem"></span></p><p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:1rem">Notice something different? I was able to escape the following flags using an empty flag notation. Infact. This padding technique works in ALMOST EVERY command line module available for linux, unix systems. Let\'s see this in action with xargs, and know that if this theory actually works.</span></p><p style="text-align:left"></p><p style="text-align:left"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5eff6381a8b8f6323ba744fe/room-content/dbca3dd790522bc5ad41d029eb1d0438.png" /><br /></p><p style="text-align:left">You can see the rm didn\'t interpreted the files inside directory as a flag when used -- padding.

I gave the padding it still showed me an error. Hmm... Did you found what was the issue? Well even if you specify that padding to escape the flags there are \'/\'s inside this string, which are making <code>touch</code>\xa0to interpret them as create the file <i>bash</i>, inside <i>bin</i> directory that is inside, some <i>--checkpoint-action=exec=</i> directory. You may try using \\/bin\\/bash to escape the slashes, but that won\'t work either, because files can\'t contain slashes in their name.</p><p style="text-align:left">We can easily bypass this by just using bash or sh instead of specifying the whole path, but make sure that your path is set to normal.
